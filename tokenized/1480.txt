there was once a young shepherd who wished much to marry , and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty , so that it was difficult to him to make a choice , and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them .
then he asked his mother for advice , and she said , " invite all three , and set some cheese before them , and watch how they eat it ."
the youth did so ; the first , however , swallowed the cheese with the rind on ; the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese , but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it , and threw that away also ; the third peeled the rind off carefully , and cut neither too much nor too little .
the shepherd told all this to his mother , who said , " take the third for thy wife ."
this he did , and lived contentedly and happily with her .
