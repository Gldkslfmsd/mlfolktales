a playful prankish dragonfly the whole summer have sung out finally , she looked about ; winter ' s already coming by .
like deceased the forest stays .
where are you , those happy days , when for her , under each tree , was a home and tart with tea ?
the evil winter took all it , leaving only some cold and need .
the dragonfly sings no more , as she used to do before .
and who would , in times that sore ?
to escape th ' untimely end , she is creeping to an ant with the bitter her lament .
" oh ", she said , " my gentle friend , i do beg you , be so dear , do not leave me to die here , give some shelter , food , and drinkfor half - a - year , till the spring ".
" did you work at all in summer ?"
asked the ant with a slight stammer , " such a speech is strange to hear ."
dragonfly said , " alas , my dear , no i didn ' t .
listen , i ' m ... just i hadn ' t any time .
whole summer we were playing ` and singing ".
" well ", answers the ant , " did you sing ?
this is the thing !
now , you ' ll have your chance to dance ."
