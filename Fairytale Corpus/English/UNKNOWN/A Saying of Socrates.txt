Though common be the name of friend,Few can to faithfulness pretend,That Socrates (whose cruel case,I'd freely for his fame embrace,And living any envy bearTo leave my character so fair)Was building of a little cot,When some one, standing on the spot,Ask'd, as the folks are apt to do," How comes so great a man as youContent with such a little hole ?"-"I wish," says he, "with all my soulThat this same little house I buildWas with true friends completely fill'd."
