Some young turkeys were lucky enough to find a tree whichserved them as a citadel against the assaults of a certain fox. He, onenight, having made the round of the rampart and seen each turkeywatching like a sentinel, exclaimed, "What! These people laugh at me, dothey? And do they think that they alone are exempt from the common rule?No! by all the gods! no!"He accomplished his design.The moon shining brilliantly seemed to favour the turkey folk againstthe fox. But he was no novice in the laying of sieges, and had recourseto his bag of rascally tricks. He pretended to climb the tree; stoodupon his hind legs; counterfeited death; then came to life again.Harlequin himself could not have acted so many parts. He reared his tailand made it gleam in the moonshine, and practised a hundred otherpleasantries, during which no turkey could have dared to go to sleep.The enemy tired them out at last by keeping their eyes fixed upon him.The poor birds became dazed. One lost its balance and fell. Reynard putit by. Then another fell and was caught and laid on one side. Nearlyhalf of them at length succumbed and were taken off to the fox's larder.To concentrate too much attention upon a danger may cause us to tumbleinto it.
