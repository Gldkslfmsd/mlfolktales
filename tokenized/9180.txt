master reynard the fox once saw a crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree .
" that ’ s for me , as i am a fox ," said master reynard , and he walked up to the foot of the tree .“ good day , mistress crow ,” he cried .
“ how well you are looking today : your feathers are so glossy ; your eyes are so bright .
i feel sure your voice must be more beautiful than that of other birds .
let me hear just one song from you , so that i may call you the queen of birds .” the crow , who really couldn ’ t sing very well , lifted up her head and began to caw her best , but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground .
master reynard snapped it up at once .“ that will do ,” said he .
“ that was all i wanted .” he looked up at the crow , and said : “ in exchange for your cheese i will give you a piece of advice for the future : ‘ do not trust flatterers .’”
