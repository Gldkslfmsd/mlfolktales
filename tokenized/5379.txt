a man had two daughters , the one married to a gardener , and the other to a tile - maker .
after a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener , and inquired how she was and how all things went with her .
she said , " all things are prospering with me , and i have only one wish , that there may be a heavy fall of rain , in order that the plants may be well watered ."
not long after , he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker , and likewise inquired of her how she fared ; she replied , " i want for nothing , and have only one wish , that the dry weather may continue , and the sun shine hot and bright , so that the bricks might be dried ."
he said to her , " if your sister wishes for rain , and you for dry weather , with which of the two am i to join my wishes ?'
