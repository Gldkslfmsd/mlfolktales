three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field , but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night .
then once when day was drawing near , and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again , she said to her husband : " if thou wilt come this afternoon and gather me , i shall be set free and henceforth stay with thee ."
and he did so .
now the question is , how did her husband know her , for the flowers were exactly alike , and without any difference ? answer : " as she was at her home during the night and not in the field , no dew fell on her as it did on the others , and by this her husband knew her ."
