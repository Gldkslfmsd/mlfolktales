a man and a satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them .
one very cold wintry day , as they talked , the man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them .
when the satyr asked the reason for this , he told him that he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold .
later on in the day they sat down to eat , and the food prepared was quite scalding .
the man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it .
when the satyr again inquired the reason , he said that he did it to cool the meat , which was too hot .
" i can no longer consider you as a friend ," said the satyr , " a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold ."
