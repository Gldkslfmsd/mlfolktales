a merchant had done good business at the fair ; he had sold his wares , and lined his money - bags with gold and silver .
then he wanted to travel homewards , and be in his own house before nightfall .
so he packed his trunk with the money on his horse , and rode away . at noon he rested in a town , and when he wanted to go farther the stable - boy brought out his horse and said , " a nail is wanting , sir , in the shoe of its left hind foot ."
- " let it be wanting ," answered the merchant ; " the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles i have still to go .
i am in a hurry .
" in the afternoon , when he once more alighted and had his horse fed , the stable - boy went into the room to him and said , " sir , a shoe is missing from your horse ' s left hind foot .
shall i take him to the blacksmith ?"
- " let it still be wanting ," answered the man ; " the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain .
i am in haste .
" he rode forth , but before long the horse began to limp .
it had not limped long before it began to stumble , and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg .
the merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was , and unbuckle the trunk , take it on his back , and go home on foot .
and there he did not arrive until quite late at night .
" and that unlucky nail ," said he to himself , " has caused all this disaster .
" hasten slowly .
