When, among partners, concord there is not. Successful issues scarce are got And the result is loss, disaster and repining. A crayfish, swan and pike combining. Resolve to draw a cart and freight ; In harness soon, their efforts ne'er abate. However much they work, the load to stir refuses. It seems to be perverse with selfwill vast endowed ; The swan makes upward for a cloud. The crayfish falls behind, the pike the river uses ; To judge of each one's merit lies beyond my will ; I know the cart remains there, still.
