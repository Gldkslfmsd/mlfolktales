a countryman one day said to his little puppies : " come into the parlour and enjoy yourselves , and pick up the bread - crumbs on the table ; your mistress has gone out to pay some visits ."
then the little dogs said : " no , no , we will not go .
if the mistress gets to know it , she will beat us ."
the countryman said : " she will know nothing about it .
do come ; after all , she never gives you anything good ."
then the little dogs again said : " nay , nay , we must let it alone ; we must not go ."
but the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went , and got on the table , and ate up the bread - crumbs with all their might .
but at that very moment the mistress came , and seized the stick in great haste , and beat them and treated them very hardly .
and when they were outside the house , the little dogs said to the countryman : " dost , dost , dost , dost , dost thou see ?"
then the countryman laughed and said : " didn ' t , didn ' t , didn ' t , you expect it ?"
so they just had to run away .
