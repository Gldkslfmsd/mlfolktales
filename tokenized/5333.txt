a famished fox saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hangingfrom a trellised vine .
she resorted to all her tricks to get atthem , but wearied herself in vain , for she could not reach them .
at last she turned away , hiding her disappointment and saying :" the grapes are sour , and not ripe as i thought ."
