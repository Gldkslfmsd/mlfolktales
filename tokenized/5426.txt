a very poor man , a carpenter by trade , had a wooden image of mercury , before which he made offerings day by day , and begged the idol to make him rich , but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer .
at last , being very angry , he took his image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall .
when its head was knocked off , out came a stream of gold , which the carpenter quickly picked up and said , " well , i think thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable ; for when i paid you honor , i reaped no benefits : but now that i maltreat you i am loaded with an abundance of riches ."
