A woodcutter had broken or lost the handle of his hatchet andfound it not easy to get it repaired at once. During the time,therefore, that it was out of use, the woods enjoyed a respite fromfurther damage. At last the man came humbly and begged of the forest toallow him gently to take just one branch wherewith to make him a newhaft, and promised that then he would go elsewhere to ply his trade andget his living. That would leave unthreatened many an oak and many a firthat now won universal respect on account of its age and beauty.The innocent forest acquiesced and furnished him with a new handle. Thishe fixed to his blade and, as soon as it was finished, fell at once uponthe trees, despoiling his benefactress, the forest, of her mostcherished ornaments. There was no end to her bewailings: her own gifthad caused her grief.Here you see the way of the world and of those who follow it. They usethe benefit against the benefactors. I weary of talking about it. Yetwho would not complain that sweet and shady spots should suffer suchoutrage. Alas! it is useless to cry out and be thought a nuisance:ingratitude and abuses will remain the fashion none the less.
