Up in a lofty oak the BeesHad made their honey-combs: but theseThe Drones asserted they had wrought.Then to the bar the cause was broughtBefore the wasp, a learned chief,Who well might argue either brief,As of a middle nature made.He therefore to both parties said:"You're not dissimilar in size,And each with each your color vies,That there's a doubt concerning both:But, lest I err, upon my oath,'Hives for yourselves directly choose,And in the wax the work infuse,That, from the flavor and the form,We may point out the genuine swarm."The Drones refuse, the Bees agree-Then thus did Justice Wasp decree:" Who can, and who cannot, is plain,So take, ye Bees, your combs again."This narrative had been suppress'dHad not the Drones refused the test.
