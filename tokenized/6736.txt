merlin said well , that those who often cheatwill sometimes cheat themselves -- the phrase is old . i ' m sorry that it is , i must repeat , it ' s full of energy , and sound as gold . but to my story : once a well fed rat , rotund and wealthy , plump and fat , not knowing either fast or lent , lounging beside a marsh pool went . a frog addressed him in the frog ' s own tongue , and asked him home to dinner civilly . no need to make the invitation long . he spoke , however , of the things he ' d see : the pleasant bath , worth curiosity ; the novelties along the marsh ' s shore , the score and scoreof spots of beauty , manners of the races , the government of various places , some day he would recount with gleeunto his youthful progeny . one thing alone the gallant vexed , and his adventurous soul perplexed ; he swam but little , and he needed aid . the friendly frog was undismayed ; his paw to hers she strongly tied , and then they started side by side . the hostess towed her frightened guestquick to the bottom of the lake -- perfidious breach of law of nations -- all promises she faithless breaks , and sinks her friend to make fresh rations . already did her appetitedwell on the morsel with delight , lunch , scrunch ! he prays the gods ; she mocks his woe ; he struggles up ; she pulls below . and while this combat is fought out , a kite that ' s seeking all aboutsees the poor rat that ' s like to drown ; and pounces swift as lightning down . the frog tied to him , by the way , also became the glad kite ' s prey ; they gave him all that he could wish , a supper both of meat and fish . so oftentimes a base deceitfalls back upon the father cheat ; so oftentimes doth perfidyreturn with triple usury .
