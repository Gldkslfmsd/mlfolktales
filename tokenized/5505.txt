the hares , oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed , with one accord determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below .
as they scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve , the frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their feet and rushed helter - skelter to the deep water for safety .
on seeing the rapid disappearance of the frogs , one of the hares cried out to his companions : " stay , my friends , do not do as you intended ; for you now see that there are creatures who are still more timid than ourselves ."
