There is no safety in allying with the strongest, and here is a story to show it. A cow, a goat and a sheep were associated with the Lion in the forest. They caught a large deer and the Lion distributed it saying: - They call me the king of the forest, so the first part is mine; you should give me the second part because I am  your partner; the third part is for me for the strength I possess; and the fourth, woe to anyone who touches it! And so, he dishonestly took it all.
