A Lion on the carcass stoodOf a young heifer in the wood;A robber that was passing there,Came up, and ask'd him for a share."A share," says he, "you should receive,But that you seldom ask our leaveFor things so handily removed."At which the ruffian was reproved.It happen'd that the selfsame dayA modest pilgrim came that way,And when he saw the Lion, fled:Says he, " There is no cause of dread,In gentle tone-take you the chine,Which to your merit I assign."-Then having parted what he slew,To favour his approach withdrew.A great example, worthy praise,But not much copied now-a-days!For churls have coffers that o'erflow,And sheepish worth is poor and low.
