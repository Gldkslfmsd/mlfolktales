Howe'er exalted in your sphere,There's something from the mean to fearFor, if their property you wrong,The poor's revenge is quick and strongWhen on a time an Eagle stoleThe cubs from out a Fox's hole,And bore them to her young away,That they might feast upon the preyThe dam pursues the winged thief,And deprecates so great a grief;But safe upon the lofty tree,The Eagle scorn'd the Fox's plea.With that the Fox perceived at handAn altar, whence she snatched a brand,And compassing with flames the wood,Put her in terror for her brood.She therefore, lest her house should burn,Submissive did the cubs return.
