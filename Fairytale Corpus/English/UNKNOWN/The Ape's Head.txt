Story ID (from ATU-website): 7985
ATU Classification Number: UNKNOWN

A certain person, as he stoodWithin the shambles buying food,Amongst the other kitchen fareBeheld an Ape suspended there;And asking how 'twould taste, when dress'd,The butcher shook his head in jest;"If for such prog your fancy is,Judge of the flavour by the phiz."This speech was not so true as keen,For I in life have often seenGood features with a wicked heart,And plainness acting virtue's part.
