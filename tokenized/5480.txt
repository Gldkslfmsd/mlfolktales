a workman , felling wood by the side of a river , let his axe drop - by accident into a deep pool .
being thus deprived of the means of his livelihood , he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate .
mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears .
after he told him his misfortune , mercury plunged into the stream , and , bringing up a golden axe , inquired if that were the one he had lost .
on his saying that it was not his , mercury disappeared beneath the water a second time , returned with a silver axe in his hand , and again asked the workman if it were his .
when the workman said it was not , he dived into the pool for the third time and brought up the axe that had been lost .
the workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery .
mercury , pleased with his honesty , gave him the golden and silver axes in addition to his own .
the workman , on his return to his house , related to his companions all that had happened .
one of them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for himself .
he ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the same place , and sat down on the bank to weep .
mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would ; and having learned the cause of his grief , plunged into the stream and brought up a golden axe , inquiring if he had lost it .
the workman seized it greedily , and declared that truly it was the very same axe that he had lost .
mercury , displeased at his knavery , not only took away the golden axe , but refused to recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool .
