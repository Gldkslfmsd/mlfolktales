He that would have the wicked reign,Instead of help will find his bane.The Doves had oft escaped the Kite,By their celerity of flight;The ruffian then to coz'nage stoop'd,And thus the tim'rous race he duped:"Why do you lead a life of fear,Rather than my proposals hear ?Elect me for your king, and IWill all your race indemnify."They foolishly the Kite believed,Who having now the pow'r received,Began upon the Doves to prey,And exercise tyrannic sway."Justly," says one who yet remain'd," We die the death ourselves ordained."
