  A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time.  Just as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired of the Bull if he would like him to go. The Bull replied, "I did not know you had come, and I shall not miss you when you go away."  Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors.
