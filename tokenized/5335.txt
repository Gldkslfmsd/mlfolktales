a bat who fell upon the ground and was caught by a weasel pleaded to be spared his life .
the weasel refused , saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds .
the bat assured him that he was not a bird , but a mouse , and thus was set free .
shortly afterwards the bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another weasel , whom he likewise entreated not to eat him .
the weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice .
the bat assured him that he was not a mouse , but a bat , and thus a second time escaped .
it is wise to turn circumstances to good account .
