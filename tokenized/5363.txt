a muleteer set forth on a journey , driving before him an ass and a mule , both well laden .
the ass , as long as he traveled along the plain , carried his load with ease , but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain , felt his load to be more than he could bear .
he entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion , that he might carry home the rest ; but the mule paid no attention to the request .
the ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden .
not knowing what else to do in so wild a region , the muleteer placed upon the mule the load carried by the ass in addition to his own , and at the top of all placed the hide of the ass , after he had skinned him .
the mule , groaning beneath his heavy burden , said to himself : " i am treated according to my deserts .
if i had only been willing to assist the ass a little in his need , i should not now be bearing , together with his burden , himself as well ."
