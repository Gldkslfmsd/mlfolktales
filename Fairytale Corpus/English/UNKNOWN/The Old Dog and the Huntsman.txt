A Dog, that time and often tried,His master always satisfied;And whensoever he assail'd,Against the forest-beasts prevail'dBoth by activity and strength,,Through years began to flag at lengthOne day, when hounded at a boar,His ear he seized, as heretofore;But with his teeth, decay'd and old,Could not succeed to keep his hold.A t which the huntsman, much concern'd,The vet'ran huff'd, who thus return'd:" My resolution and my aim,Though not my strength, are still the same;For what I am if I am chid,Praise what I was, and what I did."Philetus, you the drift perceiveOf this, with which I take my leave.
