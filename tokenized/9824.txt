a rat from town , a country ratinvited in the civilest way ; for dinner there was just to beortolans and an entrement . upon a turkey carpet softthe noble feast at last was spread ; i leave you pretty well to guessthe merry , pleasant life they led . gay the repast , for plenty reigned , nothing was wanting to the fare ; but hardly had it well begunere chance disturbed the friendly pair . a sudden racket at the dooralarmed them , and they made retreat ; the city rat was not the last , his comrade followed fast and fleet . the noise soon over , they returned , as rats on such occasions do ;" come ," said the liberal citizen ," and let us finish our ragout .
"" not a crumb more ," the rustic said ;" tomorrow you shall dine with me ; don ' t think me jealous of your state , or all your royal luxury ; but then i eat so quiet at home , and nothing dangerous is near ; good - bye , my friend , i have no lovefor pleasure when it ' s mixed with fear ."
