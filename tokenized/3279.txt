once on a time there were three billy - goats , who were to go up to the hill - side to make themselves fat , and the name of all three was " gruff .
" on the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross ; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll , with eyes as big as saucers , and a nose as long as a poker . so first of all came the youngest billy - goat gruff to cross the bridge .
" trip , trap !
trip , trap !"
went the bridge .
" who ' s that tripping over my bridge ?"
roared the troll .
" oh , it is only i , the tiniest billy - goat gruff ; and i ' m going up to the hill - side to make myself fat ," said the billy - goat , with such a small voice .
" now , i ' m coming , to gobble you up ," said the troll .
" oh , no !
pray don ' t take me .
i ' m too little , that i am ," said the billy - goat ; " wait a bit till the second billy - goat gruff comes , he ' s much bigger .
"" well , be off with you ;" said the troll . a little while after came the second billy - goat gruff to cross the bridge .
" trip , trap !
trip , trap !
trip , trap !"
went the bridge .
" who ' s that tripping over my bridge ?"
roared the troll .
" oh , it ' s the second billy - goat gruff , and i ' m going up to the hill - side to make myself fat ," said the billy - goat , who hadn ' t such a small voice .
" now i ' m coming to gobble you up ," said the troll .
" oh , no !
don ' t take me , wait a little till the big billy - goat gruff comes , he ' s much bigger .
"" very well !
be off with you ," said the troll . but just then up came the big billy - goat gruff .
" trip , trap !
trip , trap !
trip , trap !"
went the bridge , for the billy - goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him .
" who ' s that tramping over my bridge ?"
roared the troll .
" it ' s i !
the big billy - goat gruff ," said the billy - goat , who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own .
" now i ' m coming to gobble you up ," roared the troll ," well , come along !
i ' ve got two spears , and i ' ll poke your eyeballs out at your ears ; i ' ve got besides two curling - stones , and i ' ll crush you to bits , body and bones .
" that was what the big billy - goat said ; and so he flew at the troll , and poked his eyes out with his horns , and crushed him to bits , body and bones , and tossed him out into the burn , and after that he went up to the hill - side .
there the billy - goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again ; and if the fat hasn ' t fallen off them , why , they ' re still fat ; and so â€”" snip , snap , snoutthis tale ' s told out ."
