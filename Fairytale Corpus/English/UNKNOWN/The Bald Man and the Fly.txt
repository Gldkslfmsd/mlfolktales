As on his head she chanced to sit,A Man's bald pate a Gadfly bit;He, prompt to crush the little foe,Dealt on himself a grievous blow:At which the Fly, deriding said," You that would strike an insect deadFor one slight sting, in wrath so strict,What punishment will you inflictUpon yourself, who was so bluntTo do yourself this gross affront ?"-"0," says the party, "as for me,I with myself can soon agree.The spirit of th' intention's all;But thou, detested cannibal!Blood-sucker! to have thee securedMore would I gladly have endured."What by this moral tale is meantIs-those who wrong not with intentAre venial; but to those that doSeverity, I think, is due.
