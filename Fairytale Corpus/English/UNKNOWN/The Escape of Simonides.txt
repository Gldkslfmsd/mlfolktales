Th' attention letters can engage,Ev'n from a base degenerate age,I've shown before; and now shall showTheir lustre in another view,And tell a memorable tale,How much they can with heav'n prevail,Simonides, the very sameWe lately had a call to name,Agreed for such a sum to blazeA certain famous champion's praise.He therefore a retirement sought,But found the theme on which he wroteSo scanty, he was forced to useTh' accustomed license of the muse,And introduced and praise bestow'dOn Leda's sons to raise his ode;With these the rather making free,As heroes in the same degree.He warranted his work, and yetCould but one third of payment get.Upon demanding all the due," Let them," says he, "pay t' other two,Who take two places in the song;But lest you think I do you wrongAnd part in dudgeon-I inviteYour company to sup this night,For then my friends and kin I see,'Mongst which I choose to reckon thee."Choused and chagrined, yet shunning blame,He promised, set the hour, and came;As fearful lest a favour spurn'dShould to an open breach be turn'd.The splendid banquet shone with plate,And preparations full of stateMade the glad house with clamors roar-When on a sudden at the doorTwo youths , with sweat and dust besmear'd,Above the human form appear'd,And charged forthwith a little scoutTo bid Simonides come out,That 'twas his interest not to stay.-The slave, in trouble and dismay,Roused from his seat the feasting bard,Who scarce had stirr'd a single yardBefore the room at once fell in,And crushed the champion and his kin.No youths before the door are found.-The thing soon spread the country round;And when each circumstance was weighed,They knew the gods that visit made,And saved the poet's life in lieuOf those two-thirds which yet were due.
