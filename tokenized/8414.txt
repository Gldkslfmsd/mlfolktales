the gay grasshopper , full of songall the sunny season long , was unprovided and brought low , when the north wind began to blow ; had not a scrap of worm or fly , hunger and want began to cry ; never was creature more perplexed . she called upon her neighbour ant , and humbly prayed her just to grant some grain till august next ;“ i ' ll pay , ” she said , “ what ye invest , both principal and interest , honour of insects – and that ' s tender .
” the ant , however , is no lender ; that is her least defective side ;“ but , hark ye , pray , miss borrower , ” she cried , “ what were ye doing in fine weather ?
” “ singing .
.
.
nay ,!
look not thus askance , to every comer day and night together .
”“ singing !
i ' m glad of that ; why now then dance .
”
