a crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese .
coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said , " what a noble bird i see above me !
her beauty is without equal , the hue of her plumage exquisite .
if only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair , she ought without doubt to be queen of the birds ."
the crow was hugely flattered by this , and just to show the fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw .
down came the cheese , of course , and the fox , snatching it up , said , " you have a voice , madam , i see .
what you want is wits ."
