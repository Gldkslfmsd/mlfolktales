A youngster, who was doubly foolish and doubly a rogue—inwhich perhaps he savoured of the school he went to—was given, they say,to robbing a neighbour's garden of its fruit and flowers. This may havebeen because he was too young to know better, and perhaps becauseteachers do not always mould the minds of young people in the right way.The owner of the garden boasted in each season the very best of what wasdue. In spring he could show the most delightful blossoms and in autumnthe very pick of all the apples.One day he espied this schoolboy carelessly climbing a fruit tree andknocking off the buds, those sweet and fragile forerunners of promisedfruit in abundance. The urchin even broke off a bough, and did so muchother damage that the owner sent a message of complaint to the boy'sschoolmaster. This worthy soon appeared, and behind him a tribe of thescholars, who swarmed into the orchard and began behaving worse than thefirst one. The schoolmaster's plan in thus aggravating the injury wasreally to make an opportunity for delivering them all a good lesson,which they should remember all their lives. He quoted Virgil andCicero; he made many scientific allusions and ran his discourse to sucha length that the little wretches were able to get all over the gardenand despoil it in a hundred places.I hate pompous and pedantic speeches that are out of place andnever-ending; and I do not know a worse fool in the world than a naughtyschoolboy—unless indeed it be the schoolmaster of such a boy. Thebetter of them would never suit me as a neighbour.
