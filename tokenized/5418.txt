a monkey perched upon a lofty tree saw some fishermen casting their nets into a river , and narrowly watched their proceedings .
the fishermen after a while gave up fishing , and on going home to dinner left their nets upon the bank .
the monkey , who is the most imitative of animals , descended from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had done .
having handled the net , he threw it into the river , but became tangled in the meshes and drowned .
with his last breath he said to himself , " i am rightly served ; for what business had i who had never handled a net to try and catch fish ?'
