The gay grasshopper, full of songAll the sunny season long,Was unprovided and brought low,When the north wind began to blow ; Had not a scrap of worm or fly,Hunger and want began to cry ; Never was creature more perplexed.She called upon her neighbour ant,And humbly prayed her just to grant Some grain till August next ;“I'll pay, ” she said, “what ye invest, Both principal and interest,Honour of insects –and that's tender. ”The ant, however, is no lender ;That is her least defective side ;“But, hark ye, pray, Miss Borrower, ” she cried, “What were ye doing in fine weather ? ” “ Singing . . .  nay,! look not thus askance,To every comer day and night together. ”“ Singing ! I'm glad of that ; why now then dance. ”
