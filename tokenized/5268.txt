a tortoise , lazily basking in the sun , complained to thesea - birds of her hard fate , that no one would teach her to fly .
an eagle , hovering near , heard her lamentation and demanded whatreward she would give him if he would take her aloft and floather in the air .
" i will give you ," she said , " all the riches ofthe red sea ."
" i will teach you to fly then ," said the eagle ; andtaking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go , and she fell on a lofty mountain , dashingher shell to pieces .
the tortoise exclaimed in the moment ofdeath : " i have deserved my present fate ; for what had i to dowith wings and clouds , who can with difficulty move about on theearth ?'
if men had all they wished , they would be often ruined .
