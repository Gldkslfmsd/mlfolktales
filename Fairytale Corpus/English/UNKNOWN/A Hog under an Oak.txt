A Hog under a mighty OakHad glutted tons of tasty acorns, then, supine,Napped in its shade; but when awoke,He, with persistence and the snoot of real swine,The giant's roots began to undermine."The tree is hurt when they're exposed,"A Raven on a branch arose."It may dry up and perish - don't you care?""Not in the least!" The Hog raised up its head."Why would the prospect make me scared?The tree is useless; be it deadTwo hundred fifty years, I won't regret a second.Nutritious acorns - only that's what's reckoned!" -"Ungrateful pig!" The tree exclaimed with scorn."Had you been fit to turn your mug aroundYou'd have a chance to figure outWhere your beloved fruit is born."
