a fox , running before the hounds , came across a woodcutter felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding - place .
the woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut , so the fox crept in and hid himself in a corner .
the huntsman soon came up with his hounds and inquired of the woodcutter if he had seen the fox .
he declared that he had not seen him , and yet pointed , all the time he was speaking , to the hut where the fox lay hidden .
the huntsman took no notice of the signs , but believing his word , hastened forward in the chase .
as soon as they were well away , the fox departed without taking any notice of the woodcutter : whereon he called to him and reproached him , saying , " you ungrateful fellow , you owe your life to me , and yet you leave me without a word of thanks ."
the fox replied , " indeed , i should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good as your words , and if your hands had not been traitors to your speech ."
