once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess ; but she woul have to be a real princess .
he travelled all over the world to find one , but nowhere could he get what he wanted .
there were princesses enough , but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones .
there was always something about them that was not as it should be .
so he came home again and was sad , for he would have liked very much to have a real princess . one evening a terrible storm came on ; there was thunder and lightning , and the rain poured down in torrents .
suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate , and the old king went to open it . it was a princess standing out there in front of the gate .
but , good gracious !
what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look .
the water ran down from her hair and clothes ; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels .
and yet she said that she was a real princess .
" well , we ' ll soon find that out ," thought the old queen .
but she said nothing , went into the bed - room , took all the bedding off the bedstead , and laid a pea on the bottom ; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea , and then twenty eider - down beds on top of the mattresses . on this the princess had to lie all night . in the morning she was asked how she had slept .
" oh , very badly !"
said she .
" i have scarcely closed my eyes all night .
heaven only knows what was in the bed , but i was lying on something hard , so that i am black and blue all over my body .
it ' s horrible !
" now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider - down beds .
nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that . so the prince took her for his wife , for now he knew that he had a real princess ; and the pea was put in the museum , where it may still be seen , if no one has stolen it . there , that is a true story .
