As Esop was with boys at play,And had his nuts as well as they,A grave Athenian, passing by,Cast on the sage a scornful eye,As on a dotard quite bereaved:Which, when the moralist perceived,(Rather himself a wit profess'dThan the poor subject of a jest)Into the public way he flungA bow that he had just unstrung:There solve, thou conjurer," he cries,"The problem, that before thee lies."The people throng; he racks his brain,Nor can the thing enjoin'd explain.At last he gives it up-the seerThus then in triumph made it clear:" As the tough bow exerts its spring,A constant tension breaks the string;But if 'tis let at seasons loose,You may depend upon its use."Thus recreative sports and playAre good upon a holiday,And with more spirit they'll pursueThe studies which they shall renew.
