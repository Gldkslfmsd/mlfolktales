A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to thesea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded whatreward she would give him if he would take her aloft and floather in the air. "I will give you," she said, "all the riches ofthe Red Sea." "I will teach you to fly then," said the Eagle; andtaking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashingher shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment ofdeath: "I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to dowith wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on theearth?' If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.
