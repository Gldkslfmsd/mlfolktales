What God does is done well. Without going round the world toseek a proof of that, I can find one in the pumpkin.A villager was once struck with the largeness of a pumpkin and thethinness of the stem upon which it grew. "What could the Almighty havebeen thinking about?" he cried. "He has certainly chosen a bad place fora pumpkin to grow. Eh zounds! Now I would have hung it on one of theseoaks. That would have been just as it should be. Like fruit, like tree!What a pity, Hodge," said he, addressing himself, "that you were not onthe spot to give advice at the Creation which the parson preachesabout. Everything would have been properly done then. For instance;wouldn't this acorn, no bigger than my little finger, be better hangingon this frail stem? The Almighty has blundered there surely! The more Ithink about these fruits and their situations, the more it seems to methat it is all a mistake."Becoming worried by so much reflection our Hodge cast himself under anoak saying, "A man can't sleep when he has so much brain." Then he atonce dropped off into a nap.Presently an acorn fell plump upon his nose. Starting from sleep, he puthis hand up to see what had happened and found the acorn caught in hisbeard, whilst his nose began to pain and bleed. "Oh, oh!" he cried, "Iam bleeding. How would it have been if a heavier mass than this hadfallen from the tree: if this acorn had been a pumpkin? The Almighty didnot intend that, I see. Doubtless he was right. I understand the reasonwhy perfectly now."So praising God for all things Hodge took his way home.
