A Cock, while scratching all around,A Pearl upon the dunghill found:"O splendid thing in foul disgrace,Had there been any in the placeThat saw and knew thy worth when sold,Ere this thou hadst been set in gold.But I, who rather would have gotA corn of barley, heed thee not;No service can there render'd beFrom me to you, and you to me."I write this tale to them aloneTo whom in vain my pearls are thrown.
