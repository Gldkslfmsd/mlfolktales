An old man lived with his good-wifeBy the shore of the deep blue oceanIn a hovel of clay and wattle;They had lived there for three years and thirty.The old man netted fishes,The good-wife sat at her spinning.Once he cast his net on the waters;The net came up-full of sea-slime.Again he cast the net on the waters;The net came back-full of sea-weed.A third time the net sank in the watersAnd came up with one fish in it.No common fish, but a golden.The golden fish begged for mercyAnd spoke with the voice of a human:"Old man, throw me back in the ocean,I will pay you a splendid ransom:I will grant you whatever you wish for." The old man was amazed and awestruck:He had fished here for three years and thirtyBut never once heard a fish talking.Freeing the fish from the meshesHe gave him fair words and gentle:"Golden fish, go your ways in peace nowThere is no need to pay me a ransom;Go back to your deep blue seasAnd swim there and splash as you please."The old man returned to his good-wife.And what do you think? A palaceNow houses the shrewish old woman.She sits in state at her table.Great nobles and lords wait upon her,Serve her wine in a golden gobletWhile she nibbles at crested sweet-meats;Stern sentries mount guard about herEach with an axe at the ready.The old man took one look-his knees failed him!He bowed to the ground before herBut spoke out: "All hail, dread Empress!Tell me, is you heart content now?"Not a glance did his good-wife spare himBut ordered her men to remove him.Again he went down to the oceanAnd saw-a black storm had arisen:Angry waves reared up to meet him,All a-quake, all a-swirl, all a-roaring.But he raised his voice and shouted,And the golden fish came swimming:"What is it, old man, come, tell me! "With a low bow the old man made answer:"Be gracious, Lord of Fishes!What can I do with the woman?The old fool will no longer be Empress,She will rule over Sea and Ocean;In the Deep she will make her strongholdAnd have you yourself to serve herAnd swim back and forth on her errands."The golden fish said nothing;With a flick of its tail in the waterIt swam away, back to the deep sea.The old man by the shore stood waitingFor a long time, but got no answer.At last, he returned to his good-wife.
