a feeble lion , gouty , given o ' er , desired some remedy for his old age .
tell kings that remedy avails no more , ' tis waste of words , that but excites their rage .
ours ordered doctors in of every kind , for skilled there are in every branch we find .
they to the lion came from their retreats , from every side came givers of receipts .
among the visitors to show their skill , the fox dispensed with going , and lay still .
hence fawned the wolf , his absent friend belied , as the king went to bed , when quick he cried : " he shall be stifled in his room with smoke !
first bring him here ."
the fox appeared and spoke , knowing the wolf had injured him at court : " sire , i ' m afraid that some unfair report may for contempt have taken my delay thus to condole with you , and homage pay .
i ' ve been , dread sire , on pilgrimage by stealth , to pay the vows i promised for your health .
wise men and skilful met i on the way ; and your own fears from danger but too great .
sire , all you want , they said , is heat , which age in you has quenched within ; of a wolf flayed alive , then , wear the skin , quite hot and smoking from his body peeled ; a secret doubtless ne ' er before revealed : it gives to wasting nature life and ease .
here good sir wolf will serve you , if you please , with chamber robe so very choice ."
the monarch relished the advice : the wolf was flayed , and cut up in a trice ; warm in his skin the king wrapt up , upon his body straight sat down to sup .
cease , courtiers , cease to work each other ' s woe , and while ye flatter , deal no treacherous blow : quadruple wrath may wait you on the throne , which ye think calumny has made your own .
ye run a race , and as the swiftest choose , nothing is pardoned to the men that lose .
