A playful prankish Dragonfly The whole Summer have sung out Finally, she looked about;  Winter 's already coming by. Like deceased the forest stays.   Where are you, those happy days,   When for her, under each tree,  Was a home and tart with tea? The evil Winter took all it,  Leaving only some cold and need.   The Dragonfly sings no more,  As she used to do before.  And who would, in times that sore?   To escape th'untimely end,   She is creeping to an Ant  With the bitter her lament.    "Oh", she said, "My gentle friend,   I do beg you, be so dear,  Do not leave me to die here,         Give some shelter, food, and drinkFor half-a-year, Till the Spring". "Did you work at all in Summer?" Asked the Ant with a slight stammer,   "Such a speech is strange to hear."    Dragonfly said, "Alas, my dear,  No I didn't. Listen, I'm... Just I hadn't any time. Whole Summer we were playing `and  singing". "Well", answers the Ant,     "Did you sing? This is the thing! Now, you'll have your chance To dance."
