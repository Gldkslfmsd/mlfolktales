a peddler drove his ass to the seashore to buy salt .
his road home lay across a stream into which his ass , making a false step , fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter , as the water melted the sack .
the peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before .
when he came again to the stream , the ass fell down on purpose in the same spot , and , regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished , brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired .
the peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast , where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt .
the ass , again playing the fool , fell down on purpose when he reached the stream , but the sponges became swollen with water , greatly increasing his load .
and thus his trick recoiled on him , for he now carried on his back a double burden .
