a fox and a crane became friends .
the fox wanted to give her friend the crane a treat and invited him to dinner .
" come and have dinner with me , brother crane , i ' ll give you an excellent meal !
" the crane accepted the invitation and the fox made some porridge and spread it on plates .
" eat it all up , brother crane ," said the fox , " it ' s very good , i made it myself .
" the crane pecked and pecked at the plate with his long beak ; he pecked and pecked but could not get anything off the plate . meanwhile the fox was licking her plate with her tongue ; she licked and licked until the plate was quite clean .
she ate up all the porridge herself .
" don ' t be angry with me , brother crane , but that ' s all i have in the house .
there ' s nothing else to eat .
"" thank you for that , sister fox ," answered the crane .
" now you must come and have dinner with me one day .
" the fox went to the crane for dinner .
the crane had made some soup and put it in tall jars with narrow necks .
he put the jars on the table and said :" eat it all up , sister fox .
it ' s all i have in the house .
" the fox walked round and round her jar .
she tried this way and that , she licked it , she sniffed it , but not a drop of that soup could she get , for her head was too big to go into the neck of the jar . but the crane had his long beak in the jar and pecked and pecked until he had eaten all the soup .
" don ' t be angry with me , sister fox , but that ' s really all i have in the house .
" but the fox was angry .
she had thought she would eat enough to last her a week , but she went home hungry , as hungry as she had come .
the crane had given her tit for tat . since then there has been no friendship between the fox and the crane .
