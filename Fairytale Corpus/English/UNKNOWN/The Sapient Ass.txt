In all the changes of a state,The poor are the most fortunate,Who, save the name of him they callTheir king, can find no odds at all.The truth of this you now may read-A fearful old man in a mead,While leading of his Ass about,Was startled at the sudden shoutOf enemies approaching nigh.He then advised the Ass to fly,"Lest we be taken in the place:"But loth at all to mend his pace,"Pray, will the conqueror," quoth Jack,"With double panniers load my back ?""No," says the man. "If that's the thing,"Cries he, "I care not who is king."
