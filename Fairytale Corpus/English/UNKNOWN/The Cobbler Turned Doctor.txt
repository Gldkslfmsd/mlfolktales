A bankrupt Cobbler, poor and lean,(No bungler e'er was half so mean)Went to a foreign place, and thereBegan his med'cines to prepare;But one of more especial noteHe call'd his sovereign antidote;And by his technical bombastContrived to raise a name at last.It happen'd that the king was sick,Who, willing to detect the trick,Call'd for some water in an ewer,Poison in which he feign'd to pourThe antidote was likewise mix'd;He then upon th' empiric fix'dTo take the medicated cup,And, for a premium, drink it upThe quack, through dread of death, confessedThat he was of no skill possessed;But all this great and glorious jobWas made of nonsense and the mob.Then did the king his peers convoke,And thus unto th' assembly spoke:" My lords and gentlemen, I rateYour folly as inordinate,Who trust your heads into his hand,Where no one had his heels japann'd."--This story their attention cravesWhose weakness is the prey of knaves.
