When Esop saw, with inward grief,The nuptials of a neighboring thief,He thus his narrative begun:Of old 'twas rumor'd that the SunWould take a wife: with hideous criesThe quer'lous Frogs alarm'd the skies.Moved at their murmurs, Jove inquiredWhat was the thing that they desired?When thus a tenant of the lake,In terror, for his brethren spake:"Ev'n now one Sun too much is found,And dries up all the pools around,Till we thy creatures perish here;But oh, how dreadfully severe,Should he at length be made a sire,And propagate a race of fire !"
