there was once upon a time a woman who had a son and a goat .
the son was called espen and the goat they called nanny .
but they were not good friends , and did not get on together , for the goat was perverse and wayward , as goats will be , and she would never go home at the right time for her supper .
so it happened one evening that espen went out to fetch her home , and when he had been looking for her a while he saw nanny high , high up on a crag :" my dear nanny , you must not stay any longer up there ; you must come home now , it is just supper time .
i am so hungry and want my supper .
"" no , i shan ' t ," said nanny , " not before i have finished the grass on this tussock , and that tussock and this and that tussock .
"" then i ' ll go and tell mother ," said the lad .
" that you may , and then i shall be left to eat in peace ," said nanny . so espen went and told his mother .
" go to the fox and ask him to bite nanny ," said his mother . the lad went to the fox .
" my dear fox , bite nanny , for nanny won ' t come home in time .
i am so hungry , and i want my supper ," said espen .
" no , i don ' t want to spoil my snout on pig ' s bristles and goat ' s beard ," said the fox . so the lad went and told his mother .

" so the lad went and told his mother .
