A rat from town, a country ratInvited in the civilest way;For dinner there was just to beOrtolans and an entrement.Upon a Turkey carpet softThe noble feast at last was spread;I leave you pretty well to guessThe merry, pleasant life they led.Gay the repast, for plenty reigned,Nothing was wanting to the fare;But hardly had it well begunEre chance disturbed the friendly pair.A sudden racket at the doorAlarmed them, and they made retreat;The city rat was not the last,His comrade followed fast and fleet.The noise soon over, they returned,As rats on such occasions do;"Come," said the liberal citizen,"And let us finish our ragout.""Not a crumb more," the rustic said;"Tomorrow you shall dine with me;Don't think me jealous of your state,Or all your royal luxury;But then I eat so quiet at home,And nothing dangerous is near;Good-bye, my friend, I have no loveFor pleasure when it's mixed with fear."
