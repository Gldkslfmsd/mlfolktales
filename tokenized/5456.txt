a kid , returning without protection from the pasture , was pursued by a wolf .
seeing he could not escape , he turned round , and said : " i know , friend wolf , that i must be your prey , but before i die i would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to which i may dance ."
the wolf complied , and while he was piping and the kid was dancing , some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the wolf .
turning to the kid , he said , " it is just what i deserve ; for i , who am only a butcher , should not have turned piper to please you ."
