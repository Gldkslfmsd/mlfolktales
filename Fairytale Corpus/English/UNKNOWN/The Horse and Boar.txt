A Wild-Boar wallow'd in the flood,And troubled all the stream with mud,Just where a horse to drink repair'd-He therefore having war declared,Sought man's alliance for the fight,And bore upon his back the knight;Who being skill'd his darts to throw,Despatched the Wild-Boar at a blow.Then to the steed the victor said," I'm glad you came to me for aid,For taught how useful you can be,I've got at once a spoil and thee."On which the fields he made him quit,To feel the spur and champ the bit.Then he his sorrow thus express'd:"I needs must have my wrongs redress'd,And making tyrant man the judge,Must all my life become a drudge."This tale the passionate may warn,To bear with any kind of scorn;And rather all complaint withdrawThan either go to war or law.
