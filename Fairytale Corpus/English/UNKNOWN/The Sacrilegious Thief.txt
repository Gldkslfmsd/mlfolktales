A villain to Jove's altar cameTo light his candle in the flame,And robb'd the god in dead of night,By his own consecrated light:Then thus an awful voice was sent,As with the sacrilege he went:"Though all this gold and silver plateAs gifts of evil men I hate;And their removal from the faneCan cause the Deity no pain;Yet, caitiff, at th' appointed timeThy life shall answer for thy crime.But, for the future, lest this blaLe,At which the pious pray and praise,Should guide the wicked, I decreeThat no such intercourse there be."Hence to this day all men declineTo light their candle at the shrine;Nor from a candle e'er presumeThe holy light to re-illume.How many things are here contained,By him alone can be explain'dWho could this useful tale invent.In the first place, herein is meant,That they are often most your foesWho from your fost'ring hand arose.Next, that the harden'd villain's fateIs not from wrath precipitate,But rather at a destined hour.Lastly, we're charg'd with all our pow'r,To keep ourselves, by care intense,From all connexions with offence.
