once on a time there was a hare , who was frisking up and down under the greenwood tree .' oh !
hurrah !
hip , hip , hurrah !'
he cried , and leapt and sprang , and all at once he threw a somersault , and stood upon his hind legs .
just then a fox came slouching by .
' good - day , good - day ,' said the hare ; ' i ' m so merry to - day , for you must know i was married this morning .
'' lucky fellow you ,' said the fox .
' ah , no !
not so lucky after all ,' said the hare , ' for she was very heavy handed , and it was an old witch i got to wife .
' then you were an unlucky fellow ,' said the fox .
' oh , not so unlucky either ,' said the hare , ' for she was an heiress .
she had a cottage of her own .
'' then you were lucky after all ,' said the fox .
' no , no !
not so lucky either ,' said the hare , ' for the cottage caught fire and was burnt , and all we had with it .
'' that i call downright unlucky ,' said the fox .
' oh , no ; not so very unlucky after all ,' said the hare , ' for my witch of a wife was burnt along with her cottage .'
