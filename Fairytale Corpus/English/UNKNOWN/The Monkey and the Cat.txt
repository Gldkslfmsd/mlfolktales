Bertrand was a monkey and Ratter was a cat. They shared thesame dwelling and had the same master, and a pretty mischievous pairthey were. It was impossible to intimidate them. If anything was missedor spoilt, no one thought of blaming the other people in the house.Bertrand stole all he could lay his hands upon, and as for Ratter, hegave more attention to cheese than he did to the mice.One day, in the chimney corner, these two rascals sat watching somechestnuts that were roasting before the fire. How jolly it would be tosteal them they thought: doubly desirable, for it would not only be joyto themselves, but an annoyance to others."Brother," said Bertrand to Ratter, "this day you shall achieve yourmaster-stroke: you shall snatch some chestnuts out of the fire for me.Providence has not fitted me for that sort of game. If it had, I assureyou chestnuts would have a fine time."No sooner said than done. Ratter delicately stirred the cinders with hispaw, stretched out his claws two or three times to prepare for thestroke, and then adroitly whipped out first one, then two, then three ofthe chestnuts, whilst Bertrand crunched them up between his teeth. Incame a servant, and there was an end of the business. Farewell, yerogues!I am told that Ratter was by no means satisfied with the affair.And princes are equally dissatisfied when, flattered to be employed inany uncomfortable concern, they burn their fingers in a distant provincefor the profit of some king.
