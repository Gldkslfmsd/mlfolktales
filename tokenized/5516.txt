a shepherd - boy , who watched a flock of sheep near a village , brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out , " wolf !
wolf !"
and when his neighbors came to help him , laughed at them for their pains .
the wolf , however , did truly come at last .
the shepherd - boy , now really alarmed , shouted in an agony of terror : " pray , do come and help me ; the wolf is killing the sheep "; but no one paid any heed to his cries , nor rendered any assistance .
the wolf , having no cause of fear , at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock .
there is no believing a liar , even when he speaks the truth .
