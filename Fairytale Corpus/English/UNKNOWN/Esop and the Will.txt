That one man sometimes is more shrewdThan a stupendous multitude,To after-times I shall rehearseIn my concise familiar verse.A certain man on his decease,Left his three girls so much a-piece:The first was beautiful and frail,With eyes still hunting for the male;The second giv'n to spin and card,A country housewife working hard;The third but very ill to pass,A homely slut, that loved her glas.The dying man had left his wifeExecutrix, and for her lifeSole tenant, if she should fulfilThese strange provisos of his will:" That she should give th' estate in feeIn equal portions to the three;But in such sort, that this bequestShould not be holden or possess'd;Then soon as they should be bereav'nOf all the substance that was giv'n,They must for their good mother's easeMake up an hundred sesterces."This spread through Athens in a trice;The prudent widow takes advice.But not a lawyer could unfoldHow they should neither have nor holdThe very things that they were left.Besides, when once they were bereft,How they from nothing should conferThe money that was due to her.When a long time was spent in vain,And no one could the will explain,She left the counsellors unfeed,And thus of her own self decreed:The minstrels, trinkets, plate, and dres,She gave the Lady to possess.Then Mrs. Notable she stocksWith all the fields, the kine and flocks:The workmen, farm, with a supplyOf all the tools of husbandry.Last, to the Guzzler she consignsThe cellar stored with good old wine,A handsome house to see a friend,With pleasant gardens at the end.Thus as she strove th' affair to close,By giving each the things they chose,And those that knew them every oneHighly applauded what was doneEsop arose, and thus address'dThe crowd that to his presence pressed:"O that the dead could yet perceive!How would the prudent father grieve,That all th' Athenians had not skillEnough to understand his will!Then at their joint request he solvedThat error, which had all involved." The gardens, house, and wine vaults too,Give to the spinster as her due;The clothes, the jewels, and such ware,Be all the tippling lady's share;The fields, the barns, and flocks of sheep,Give the gay courtesan to keep.Not one will bear the very touchOf things that thwart their tastes so much 'The slut to fill her cellar straightHer wardrobe will evacuate;The lady soon will sell her farms,For garments to set off her charms;But she that loves the flocks and kineWill alienate her stores of wine,Her rustic genius to employ.Thus none their portions shall enjoy,And from the money each has madeTheir mother shall be duly paid."Thus one man by his wit disclosedThe point that had so many posed.
