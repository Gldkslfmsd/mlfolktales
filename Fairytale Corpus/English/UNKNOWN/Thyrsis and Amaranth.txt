A shepherd who was deeply in love with a shepherdess wassitting one day by her side trying to find words to express the emotionsher charms created in his breast."Ah! Amaranth, dear," he sighed, "could you but feel, as I do, a certainpain which, whilst it tears the heart, is so delightful that itenchants, you would say that nothing under heaven is its equal. Let metell you of it. Believe me, trust me. Would I deceive you? You, for whomI am filled with the tenderest sentiments the heart can feel!""And what, my Thyrsis, is the name you give this pleasing pain?""It is called love," said Thyrsis."Ah!" responded the maiden, "that is a beautiful name. Tell me by whatsigns I may know it, if it come to me. What are the feelings it givesone?"Thyrsis, taking heart of grace, replied with much ardour: "One feels ananguish beside which the joys of kings are but dull and insipid. Oneforgets oneself, and takes pleasure in the solitudes of the woods. Toglance into a brook is to see, not oneself, but an ever-haunting image.To any other form one's eyes are blind. It may be that there is ashepherd in the village at whose voice, at the mention of whose name,you will blush; at the thought of whom you will sigh. Why, one knowsnot! To see him will be a burning desire, and yet you would shrink fromhim.""Oho!" said Amaranth. "Is this then the pain you have preached so much!It is hardly new to me. I seem to know something of it." The heart ofThyrsis leapt, for he thought that at last he had gained his end; whenthe fair one added, "'Tis just in this way that I feel for Cladimant!"Imagine the vexation and misery of poor Thyrsis!How many like him, intending to work solely for themselves, prove onlyto have been stepping stones for others.
