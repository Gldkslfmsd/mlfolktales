once on a time there was an old beggar - woman , who had gone out to beg .
she had a little lad with her , and when she had got her bag full , she struck across the hills towards her own home .
so when they had gone a bit up the hill - side they came upon a little blue belt , which lay where two paths met , and the lad asked his mother ' s leave to pick it up .
" no ," said she , " may be there ' s witchcraft in it ;" and so with threats she forced him to follow her .
but when they had gone a bit farther the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road , and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree - stump .
but the lad was a long time gone , for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him , he ran off to where the belt lay , took it up , tied it round his waist , and lo !
he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill .
when he got back , the old dame was in a great rage , and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while .
" you don ' t care how much time you waste , and yet you know the night is drawing on , and we must cross the hill before it is dark !"
so on they tramped , but when they had got about half - way , the old dame grew weary , and said she must rest under a bush .
" dear mother ," said the lad , " mayn ' t i just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest , and try if i can ' t see some sign of folk hereabouts ?
" yes , he might do that ; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north .
so he ran down and told his mother .
" we must get on , mother ; we are near a house , for i see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north ."
then she rose and shouldered her bag , and set off to see ; but they hadn ' t gone far , before there stood a steep spur of the hill , right across their path .
" just as i thought !"
said the old dame ; " now we can ' t go a step farther ; a pretty bed we shall have here !
" but the lad took the bag under one arm , and his mother under the other , and ran straight up the steep crag with them .
" now , don ' t you see !
don ' t you see that we are close to a house !
don ' t you see the bright light ?
" but the old dame said those were no christian folk , but trolls , for she was at home in all that forest far and near , and knew there was not a living soul in it until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side .
but they went on , and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red .
" what ' s the good ?"
said the old dame , " we daren ' t go in , for here the trolls live .
"" don ' t say so ; we must go in .
there must be men where the lights shine so ," said the lad .
so in he went , and his mother after him , but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away , for there she saw a great stout man , at least twenty feet high , sitting on the bench .
" good evening , grandfather !"
said the lad .
" well , here i ' ve sat three hundred years ," said the man who sat on the bench , " and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before ."
then the lad sat down by the man ' s side , and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends .
" but what ' s come over your mother ?"
said the man , after they had chattered a while .
" i think she swooned away ; you had better look after her .
" so the lad went and took hold of the old dame ; and dragged her up the hall along the floor .
that brought her to herself , and she kicked and scratched , and flung herself about , and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner ; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face . after a while , the lad asked if they could spend the night there .
" yes , to be sure ," said the man . so they went on talking again , but the lad soon got hungry , and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging .
" of course ," said the man , " that might be got too ."
and after he had sat a while longer , he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch - pine on the fire .
this made the old hag , still more afraid ." oh !
now he ' s going to roast us alive ," she said , in the corner where she sat . and when the wood had burned down to glowing embers , up got the man and strode out of his house .
" heaven bless and help us !
what a stout heart you have got ," said the old dame ; " don ' t you see we have got amongst trolls ?
"" stuff and nonsense !"
said the lad ; " no harm if we have .
" in a little while back came the man with an ox so fat and big the lad had never seen its like , and he gave it one blow with his fist under the ear , and down it fell dead on the floor .
when that was done , he took it up by all the four legs , and laid it on the glowing embers , and turned it and twisted it about till it was burnt brown outside .
after that , he went to a cupboard and took out a great silver dish and laid the ox on it ; and the dish was so big that none of the ox hung over on any side .
this he put on the table , and then he went down into the cellar , and fetched a cask of wine , knocked out the head , and put the cask on the table , together with two knives , which were each six feet long .
when this was done , he bade them go and sit down to supper and eat .
so they went , the lad first and the old dame after , but she began to whimper and wail , and to wonder how she should ever use such knives .
but her son seized one , and began to cut slices out of the thigh of the ox , which he placed before his mother .
and when they had eaten a bit , he took up the cask with both hands , and lifted it down to the floor ; then he told his mother to come and drink , but it was still so high she couldn ' t reach up to it ; so he caught her up , and held her up to the edge of the cask while she drank ; as for himself , he clambered up and hung down like a cat inside the cask while he drank .
so when he had quenched his thirst , he took up the cask and put it back on the table , and thanked the man for the good meal , and told his mother to come and thank him too , and afeared though she was , she dared do nothing else but thank the man .
then the lad sat down again alongside the man and began to gossip , and after they had sat a while , the man said ,—" well , i must just go and get a bit of supper too and so he went to the table and ate up the whole ox — hoofs , and horns , and all — and drained the cask to the last drop , and then went back and sat on the bench .
" as for beds ," he said , " i don ' t know what ' s to be done .
i ' ve only got one bed and a cradle ; but we could get on pretty well if you would sleep in the cradle , and then your mother might lie in the bed yonder .
"" thank you kindly , that ' ll do nicely ," said the lad ; and with that he pulled off his clothes and lay down in the cradle ; but to tell you the truth , it was quite as big as a four - poster .
as for the old dame , she had to follow the man , who showed her to bed , though she was out of her wits for fear .
" well ," thought the lad to himself , " ' twill never do to go to sleep yet .
i ' d best lie awake and listen how things go as the night wears on .
" so after a while the man began to talk to the old dame , and at last he said ,—" we two might live here so happily together , could we only be rid of this son of yours .
"" but do you know how to settle him ?
is that what you ' re thinking of ?"
said she .
" nothing easier ," said he ; at any rate he would try .
he would just say he wished the old dame would stay and keep house for him a day or two , and then he would take the lad out with him up the hill to quarry corner - stones , and roll down a great rock on him .
all this the lad lay and listened to . next day the troll — for it was a troll as clear as day — asked if the old dame would stay and keep house for him a few days ; and as the day went on he took a great iron crowbar , and asked the lad if he had a mind to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner - stones .
with all his heart he said , and went with him ; and so , after they had split a few stones , the troll wanted him to go down below and look after cracks in the rock ; and while he was doing this , the troll worked away , and wearied himself with his crowbar till he moved a whole crag out of its bed , which came rolling right down on the place where the lad was ; but he held it up till he could get on one side , and then let it roll on ." oh !"
said the lad to the troll , " now i see what you mean to do with me .
you want to crush me to death ; so just go down yourself and look after the cracks and refts in the rock , and i ' ll stand up above .
" the troll did not dare to do otherwise than the lad bade him , and the end of it was that the lad rolled down a great rock , which fell upon the troll , and broke one of his thighs ." well !
you are in a sad plight ," said the lad , as he strode down , lifted up the rock , and set the man free .
after that he had to put him on his back and carry him home ; so he ran with him as fast as a horse , and shook him so that the troll screamed and screeched as if a knife were run into him .
and when he got home , they had to put the troll to bed , and there he lay in a sad pickle . when the night wore on the troll began to talk to the old dame again , and to wonder however they could be rid of the lad .
" well ," said the old dame , " if you can ' t hit on a plan to get rid of him , i ' m sure i can ' t .
"" let me see ," said the troll ; " i ' ve got twelve lions in a garden ; if they could only get hold of the lad they ' d soon tear him to pieces .
" so the old dame said it would be easy enough to get him there .
she would sham sick , and say she felt so poorly , nothing would do her any good but lion ' s milk .
all that the lad lay and listened to ; and when he got up in the morning his mother said she was worse than she looked , and she thought she should never be right again unless she could get some lion ' s milk .
" then i ' m afraid you ' ll be poorly a long time , mother ," said the lad , " for i ' m sure i don ' t know where any is to be got ."" oh !
if that be all ," said the troll , " there ' s no lack of lion ' s milk , if we only had the man to fetch it ;" and then he went on to say how his brother had a garden with twelve lions in it , and how the lad might have the key if he had a mind to milk the lions .
so the lad took the key and a milking pail , and strode off ; and when he unlocked the gate and got into the garden , there stood all the twelve lions on their hind - paws , rampant and roaring at him .
but the lad laid hold of the biggest , and led him about by the fore - paws , and dashed him against stocks and stones , till there wasn ' t a bit of him left but the two paws .
so when the rest saw that , they were so afraid that they crept up and lay at his feet like so many curs .
after that they followed him about wherever he went , and when he got home they laid down outside the house , with their fore - paws on the door sill .
" now , mother , you ' ll soon be well ," said the lad , when he went in , " for here is the lion ' s milk .
" he had just milked a drop in the pail . but the troll , as he lay in bed , swore it was all a lie .
he was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions . when the lad heard that , he forced the troll to get out of bed , threw open the door , and all the lions rose up and seized the troll , and at last the lad had to make them leave their hold . that night the troll began to talk to the old dame again .
" i ' m sure i can ' t tell how to put this lad out of the way — he is so awfully strong ; can ' t you think of some way ?
"" no ," said the old dame ; " if you can ' t tell , i ' m sure i can ' t .
"" well ," said the troll , " i have two brothers in a castle ; they are twelve times as strong as i am , and that ' s why i was turned out and had to put up with this farm .
they hold that castle , and round it there is an orchard with apples in it , and whoever eats those apples sleeps for three days and three nights .
if we could only get the lad to go for the fruit , he wouldn ' t be able to keep from tasting the apples , and as soon as ever he fell asleep my brothers would tear him in pieces .
" the old dame said she would sham sick , and say she could never be herself again unless she tasted those apples ; for she had set her heart on them . all this the lad lay and listened to . when the morning came the old dame was so poorly that she couldn ' t utter a word but groans and sighs .
she was sure she should never be well again , unless she had some of those apples that grew in the orchard near the castle where the man ' s brothers lived ; only she had no one to send for them . oh !
the lad was ready to go that instant ; but the eleven lions went with him .
so when he came to the orchard , he climbed up into the apple - tree and ate as many apples as he could , and he had scarce got down before he fell into a deep sleep ; but the lions all lay round him in a ring .
the third day came the troll ' s brothers , but they did not come in man ' s shape .
they came snorting like man - eating steeds , and wondered who it was that dared to be there , and said they would tear him to pieces so small that there should not be a bit of him left .
but up rose the lions and tore the trolls into small pieces , so that the place looked as if a dungheap had been tossed about it ; and when they had finished the trolls they lay down again .
the lad did not wake till late in the afternoon , and when he got on his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes , he began to wonder what had been going on , when he saw the marks of hoofs .
but when he went towards the castle , a maiden looked out of a window who had seen all that had happened , and she said ,—" you may thank your stars you weren ' t in that tussle , else you must have lost your life ."" what !
i lose my life !
no fear of that , i think ," said the lad . so she begged him to come in , that she might talk with him , for she hadn ' t seen a christian soul ever since she came there .
but when she opened the door the lions wanted to go in too , but she got so frightened that she began to scream , and so the lad let them lie outside .
then the two talked and talked , and the lad asked how it came that she , who was so lovely , could put up with those ugly trolls .
she never wished it , she said ; ' twas quite against her will .
they had seized her by force , and she was the king of arabia ' s daughter .
so they talked on , and at last she asked him what he would do ; whether she should go back home , or whether he would have her to wife .
of course he would have her , and she shouldn ' t go home . after that they went round the castle , and at last they came to a great hall , where the trolls ' two great swords hung high up on the wall .
" i wonder if you are man enough to wield one of these ," said the princess ." who ?— i ?"
said the lad . "
' twould be a pretty thing if i couldn ' t wield one of these .
" with that he put two or three chairs one atop of the other , jumped up , and touched the biggest sword with his finger tips , tossed it up in the air , and caught it again by the hilt ; leapt down , and at the same time dealt such a blow with it on the floor , that the whole hall shook .
after he had thus got down he thrust the sword under his arm and carried it about with him . so when they had lived a little while in the castle , the princess thought she ought to go home to her parents , and let them know what had become of her ; so they loaded a ship , and she set sail from the castle . after she had gone , and the lad had wandered about a little , he called to mind that he had been sent on an errand thither , and had come to fetch something for his mother ' s health ; and though he said to himself ,—" after all , the old dame was not so bad but she ' s all right by this time ,"— still he thought he ought to go and just see how she was .
so he went and found both the man and his mother quite fresh and hearty .
" what wretches you are to live in this beggarly hut ," said the lad .
" come with me up to my castle , and you shall see what a fine fellow i am ." well !
they were both ready to go , and on the way his mother talked to him , and asked , " how it was he had got so strong ?
"" if you must know , it came of that blue belt which lay on the hill - side that time when you and i were out begging ," said the lad .
" have you got it still ?"
asked she .
" yes ,"— he had .
it was tied round his waist .
" might she see it ?
"" yes , she might ;" and with that he pulled open his waistcoat and shirt to show it her . then she seized it with both hands , tore it off , and twisted it round her fist .
" now ," she cried , " what shall i do with such a wretch as you ?
i ' ll just give you one blow , and dash your brains out !
"" far too good a death for such a scamp ," said the troll .
" no !
let ' s first burn out his eyes , and then turn him adrift in a little boat .
" so they burned out his eyes and turned him adrift , in spite of his prayers and tears ; but , as the boat drifted , the lions swam after , and at last they laid hold of it and dragged it ashore on an island , and placed the lad under a fir - tree .
they caught game for him , and they plucked the birds and made him a bed of down ; but he was forced to eat his meat raw , and he was blind .
at last , one day the biggest lion was chasing a hare which was blind , for it ran straight over stock and stone , and the end was , it ran right up against a fir - stump and tumbled head over heels across the field right into a spring ; but lo !
when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain , and so saved its life .
" so , so !"
thought the lion , and went and dragged the lad to the spring , and dipped him over head and ears in it .
so , when he had got his sight again , he went down to the shore and made signs to the lions that they should all lie close together like a raft ; then he stood upon their backs while they swam with him to the mainland .
when he had reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse , and made the lions lie quiet .
then he stole up to the castle , like a thief , to see if he couldn ' t lay hands on his belt ; and when he got to the door , he peeped through the keyhole , and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door in the kitchen .
so he crept softly in across the floor , for there was no one there ; but as soon as he got hold of the belt , he began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad .
just then his mother came rushing out ,—" dear heart , my darling little boy !
do give me the belt again ," she said .
" thank you kindly ," said he .
" now you shall have the doom you passed on me ," and he fulfilled it on the spot .
when the old troll heard that , he came in and begged and prayed so prettily that he might not be smitten to death .
" well , you may live ," said the lad , " but you shall undergo the same punishment you gave me ;" and so he burned out the troll ' s eyes , and turned him adrift on the sea in a little boat , but he had no lions to follow him . now the lad was all alone , and he went about longing and longing for the princess ; at last he could bear it no longer ; he must set out to seek her , his heart was so bent on having her .
so he loaded four ships and set sail for arabia .
for some time they had fair wind and fine weather , but after that they lay wind - bound under a rocky island .
so the sailors went ashore and strolled about to spend the time , and there they found a huge egg , almost as big as a little house .
so they began to knock it about with large stones , but , after all , they couldn ' t crack the shell .
then the lad came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about , and when he saw the egg , he thought it a trifle to crack it ; so he gave it one blow and the egg split , and out came a chicken as big as an elephant .
" now we have done wrong ," said the lad ; " this can cost us all our lives " and then he asked his sailors if they were men enough to sail to arabia in four - and - twenty hours , if they got a fine breeze .
yes , they were good to do that , they said , so they set sail with a fine breeze , and got to arabia in three - and - twenty hours .
as soon as they landed , the lad ordered all the sailors to go and bury themselves up to the eyes in a sandhill , so that they could barely see the ships .
the lad and the captains climbed a high crag and sate down under a fir .
in a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws , and let it fall down on the fleet , and sank every ship .
after it had done that , it flew up to the sandhill and flapped its wings , so that the wind nearly took off the heads of the sailors , and it flew past the fir with such force that it turned the lad right about , but he was ready with his sword , and gave the bird one blow and brought it down dead . after that he went to the town , where every one was glad because the king had got his daughter back ; but now the king had hidden her away somewhere himself , and promised her hand as a reward to any one who could find her , and this though she was betrothed before .
now as the lad went along he met a man who had white bear - skins for sale , so he bought one of the hides and put it on ; and one of the captains was to take an iron chain and lead him about , and so he went into the town and began to play pranks .
at last the news came to the king ' s ears that there never had been such fun in the town before , for here was a white bear that danced and cut capers just as it was bid .
so a messenger came to say the bear must come to the castle at once , for the king wanted to see its tricks .
so when it got to the castle every one was afraid , for such a beast they had never seen before ; but the captain said there was no danger unless they laughed at it .
they mustn ' t do that , else it would tear them to pieces .
when the king heard that , he warned all the court not to laugh .
but while the fun was going on , in came one of the king ' s maids , and began to laugh and make game of the bear , and the bear flew at her and tore her , so that there was scarce a rag of her left .
then all the court began to bewail , and the captain most of all .
" stuff and nonsense ," said the king ; " she ' s only a maid , besides it ' s more my affair than yours .
" when the show was over , it was late at night .
" it ' s no good your going away when it ' s so late ," said the king .
" the bear had best sleep here .
"" perhaps it might sleep in the ingle by the kitchen fire ," said the captain .
" nay ," said the king , " it shall sleep up here , and it shall have pillows and cushions to sleep on ."
so a whole heap of pillows and cushions was brought , and the captain had a bed in a side - room . but at midnight the king came with a lamp in his hand and a big bunch of keys , and carried off the white bear .
he passed along gallery after gallery , through doors and rooms , up - stairs and down - stairs , till at last he came to a pier which ran out into the sea .
then the king began to pull and haul at posts and pins , this one up and that one down , till at last a little house floated up to the water ' s edge .
there he kept his daughter , for she was so dear to him that he had hid her , so that no one could find her out .
he left the white bear outside while he went in and told her how it had danced and played its pranks .
she said she was afraid , and dared not look at it ; but he talked her over , saying there was no danger , if she only wouldn ' t laugh .
so they brought the bear in , and locked the door , and it danced and played its tricks ; but just when the fun was at its height the princess ' s maid began to laugh .
then the lad flew at her and tore her to bits , and the princess began to cry and sob .
" stuff and nonsense ," cried the king ; " all this fuss about a maid !
i ' ll get you just as good a one again .
but now i think the bear had best stay here till morning , for i don ' t care to have to go and lead it along all those galleries and stairs at this time of night !
"" well ," said the princess , " if it sleeps here i ' m sure i won ' t .
" but just then the bear curled himself up and lay down by the stove ; and it was settled at last that the princess should sleep there too , with a light burning .
but as soon as the king was well gone , the white bear came and begged her to undo his collar .
the princess was so scared she almost swooned away ; but she felt about till she found the collar , and she had scarce undone it before the bear pulled his head off .
then she knew him again , and was so glad , there was no end to her joy , and she wanted to tell her father at once that her deliverer was come .
but the lad would not hear of it ; he would earn her once more , he said .
so in the morning , when they heard the king rattling at the posts outside , the lad drew on the hide , and lay down by the stove .
" well , has it lain still ?"
the king asked .
" i should think so ," said the princess ; " it hasn ' t so much as turned or stretched itself once .
" when they got up to the castle again , the captain took the bear and led it away , and then the lad threw off the hide , and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a prince ; and when they were fitted on he went to the king , and said he wanted to find the princess .
" you ' re not the first who has wished the same thing ," said the king , " but they have all lost their lives ; for if any one who tries can ' t find her in four - and - twenty hours his life is forfeited .
" yes ; the lad knew all that .
still he wished to try , and if he couldn ' t find her , ' twas his look - out .
now in the castle there was a band that played sweet tunes , and there were fair maids to dance with , and so the lad danced away .
when twelve hours were gone , the king said ,—" i pity you with all my heart .
you ' re so poor a hand at seeking ; you will surely lose your life ."" stuff !"
said the lad ; " while there ' s life there ' s hope .
so long as there ' s breath in the body there ' s no fear ; we have lots of time ;" and so he went on dancing till there was only one hour left . then he said he would begin to search .
" it ' s no use now ," said the king ; " time ' s up .
"" light your lamp ; out with your big bunch of keys ," said the lad , " and follow me whither i wish to go .
there is still a whole hour left .
" so the lad went the same way which the king had led him the night before , and he bade the king unlock door after door till they came down to the pier which ran out into the sea .
" it ' s all no use , i tell you ," said the king ; " time ' s up , and this will only lead you right out into the sea .
"" still five minutes more ," said the lad , as he pulled and pushed at the posts and pins , and the house floated up .
" now the time is up ," bawled the king ; " come hither , headsman , and take off his head .
"" nay , nay !"
said the lad ; " stop a bit , there are still three minutes .
out with the key , and let me get into this house .
" but there stood the king and fumbled with his keys , to draw out the time .
at last he said he hadn ' t any key .
" well , if you haven ' t , i have ," said the lad , as he gave the door such a kick that it flew to splinters inwards on the floor . at the door the princess met him , and told her father this was her deliverer , on whom her heart was set .
so she had him ; and this was how the beggar boy came to marry the king ' s daughter of arabia .
