Reputations may be made by the merest chances, and yetreputations control the fashions. That is a little prologue that wouldfit the case of all sorts of people. Everywhere around one seesprejudices, scheming, and obtuseness; but little or no justice. Nothingcan be done to stem this torrent of evil. It must run its course. Italways has been and always will be.A woman in Paris once made it her profession to tell fortunes. Shebecame very popular and had great success. Did anybody lose a bit offinery; had any one a sweetheart; had any wife a husband she was tiredof; any husband a jealous wife, to the prophetess such would run simplyto be told the thing that it was comforting to hear.The stock-in-trade of this fortune-teller consisted merely of aconvincing manner, a few words of scientific jargon, a great deal ofimpudence, and much good luck. All these things together so impressedthe people that as often as not they would cry, "Miraculous!" In short,although the woman's ignorance was quite twenty-three carat she passedfor a veritable oracle.Notwithstanding the fact that this oracle only lived in a garret, shefound so many ready to pay her well for her shams that she soon grewrich enough to improve the position of her husband, to rent an office,and buy a house.The garret being left empty was shortly tenanted by another woman towhom all the town—women, girls, valets, fine gentlemen—everybody infact swarmed, as before, to consult their destiny. The former tenant hadbuilt up such a reputation that the garret was still a sibyl's den, inspite of the fact that quite a different creature dwelt in it. "I tellfortunes? Surely you're joking! Why, gentlemen, I cannot read, and asfor writing, I never learnt more than to make my mark." But thesedisclaimers were useless. People insisted on having their fortunes told,and she had to do it. In consequence, she put by plenty of money, beingable to earn, in spite of herself, quite as much as two lawyers could.The poverty of her home was a help rather than a hindrance. Four brokenchairs and a broom-handle savoured of a witch's frolic.If this woman had told the truth in a room well-furnished she would havebeen scorned. The fashion for a garret had set in, and garret it mustbe.In her new chambers the first fortune-teller waited in vain; for it wasthe outward sign alone that brought customers, and the sign was poverty.I have seen in a palace a robe worn awry win much distinction andsuccess, such crowds of followers and adherents did it draw. You maywell ask me why!The garret was still a sybil's den.
