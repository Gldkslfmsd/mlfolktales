Her favorite bird to Juno came,And was in dudgeon at the dame,That she had not attuned her throatWith Philomela's matchless note;" She is the wonder of all ears;But when I speak the audience sneersThe goddess to the bird replied,(Willing to have him pacified,)" You are above the rest enduedWith beauty and with magnitude;Your neck the emerald's gloss outvie?,And what a blaze of gemmeous diesShines from the plumage of your tail!"" All this dumb show will not avail,"Cries he, "if I'm surpass'd in voice."" The fates entirely have the choiceOf all the lots-fair form is yours;The eagle's strength his prey secures;The nightingale can sing an ode;The crow and raven may forebode:All these in sheer contentment craveNo other voice than Nature gave."By affectation be not sway'd,Where Nature has not lent her aid;Nor to that flattering hope attend,Which must in disappointment end.
