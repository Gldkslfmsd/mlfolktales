Once upon a time there were two dogs, one named Lurcher and theother Cæsar. They were brothers; handsome, well-built, and plucky, anddescended from dogs who were famous in their day. These two brothers,falling into the hands of different masters, found their destinieslikewise in different spheres; for whilst one haunted the forests, theother lurched about a kitchen.The names to which they now answered were not, however, the names thatwere first given them. The influence of each one's career upon hisnature brought about a new name and a new reputation; for Cæsar's naturewas improved and strengthened by the life he led, whilst Lurcher's wasmade more and more despicable by a degraded existence. A scullion namedhim Lurcher; but the other dog received his noble name on account of hislife of high adventure. He had held many a stag at bay, killed many ahare, and otherwise risen to the position of a Cæsar among dogs. Carewas taken that he should not mate indiscriminately, so that hisdescendants' blood should not degenerate. On the other hand, poorLurcher bestowed his affections wherever he would and his brood becamepopulous. He was the progenitor of all turn-spits in France; a varietywhich became common enough to form at last a race in themselves. Theyshow more readiness to flee than to attack, and are the very antipodesof the Cæsars.We do not always follow our ancestors, nor even resemble our fathers.Want of care, the flight of time, a thousand things, cause us todegenerate.Ah! how many, Cæsars, failing to cultivate their best nature and theirgifts, become Lurchers!
