a lion asleep in his lair was awoken by a mouse running over his face .
losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it .
the mouse , terrified , piteously begged him to spare its life .
" please let me go ," it cried , " and one day i will repay you for your kindness ."
the idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the lion so much that he laughed aloud , and good - humouredly let it go .
but the mouse ' s chance came , after all .
one day the lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters , and the mouse heard and recognized his roars of anger and ran to the spot .
without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth , and succeeded before long in setting the lion free .
" there !"
said the mouse , " you laughed at me when i promised i would repay you : but now you see , even a mouse can help a lion ."
