in those days when our lord and st . peter wandered upon earth , they came once to an old wife ' s house , who sat baking .
her name was gertrude , and she had a red mutch on her head .
they had walked a long way , and were both hungry , and our lord begged hard for a bannock to stay their hunger .
yes , they should have it .
so she took a tiny little piece of dough and rolled it out , but as she rolled it , it grew and grew till it covered the whole griddle . nay , that was too big ; they couldn ' t have that .
so she took a tinier bit still ; but when that was rolled out it covered the whole griddle just the same , and that bannock was too big , she said ; they couldn ' t have that either . the third time she took a still tinier bit — so tiny you could scarce see it ; but it was the same story over again — the bannock was too big .
" well ," said gertrude , " i can ' t give you anything ; you must just go without , for all these bannocks are too big .
" then our lord waxed wroth , and said ,—" since you love me so little as to grudge me a morsel of food , you shall have this punishment ,— you shall become a bird , and seek your food between bark and bole , and never get a drop to drink save when it rains .
" he had scarce said the last word before she was turned into a great black woodpecker , or gertrude ' s bird , and flew from her kneading - trough right up the chimney ; and till this very day you may see her flying about , with her red mutch on her head , and her body all black , because of the soot in the chimney ; and so she hacks and taps away at the trees for her food , and whistles when rain is coming , for she is ever athirst , and then she looks for a drop to cool her tongue .
