The luckless wretch that's born to woeMust all his life affliction know-And harder still, his cruel fateWill on his very ashes wait,Cybele's priests, in quest of bread,An Ass about the village led,With things for sale from door to door;Till work'd and beaten more and more,At length, when the poor creature died,They made them drums out of his hide.Then question'd "how it came to passThey thus could serve ther darling Ass ?"The answer was, " He thought of peaceIn death, and that his toils would cease;But see his mis'ry knows no bounds,Still with our blows his back resounds."
