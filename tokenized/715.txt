it happened that the cat met the fox in a forest , and as she thought to herself , " he is clever and full of experience , and much esteemed in the world ," she spoke to him in a friendly way .
" good - day , dear mr . fox , how are you ?
how is all with you ?
how are you getting through this dear season ?"
the fox , full of all kinds of arrogance , looked at the cat from head to foot , and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not .
at last he said , " oh , thou wretched beard - cleaner , thou piebald fool , thou hungry mouse - hunter , what canst thou be thinking of ?
dost thou venture to ask how i am getting on ?
what hast thou learnt ?
how many arts dost thou understand ?"
- " i understand but one ," replied the cat , modestly .
" what art is that ?"
asked the fox .
" when the hounds are following me , i can spring into a tree and save myself ."
- " is that all ?"
said the fox .
" i am master of a hundred arts , and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning .
thou makest me sorry for thee ; come with me , i will teach thee how people get away from the hounds ."
just then came a hunter with four dogs .
the cat sprang nimbly up a tree , and sat down on top of it , where the branches and foliage quite concealed her .
" open your sack , mr . fox , open your sack ," cried the cat to him , but the dogs had already seized him , and were holding him fast .
" ah , mr . fox ," cried the cat .
" you with your hundred arts are left in the lurch !
had you been able to climb like me , you would not have lost your life ."
