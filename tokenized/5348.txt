a farmer placed nets on his newly - sown plowlands and caught a number of cranes , which came to pick up his seed .
with them he trapped a stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the farmer to spare his life .
" pray save me , master ," he said , " and let me go free this once .
my broken limb should excite your pity .
besides , i am no crane , i am a stork , a bird of excellent character ; and see how i love and slave for my father and mother .
look too , at my feathers -- they are not the least like those of a crane ."
the farmer laughed aloud and said , " it may be all as you say , i only know this : i have taken you with these robbers , the cranes , and you must die in their company ."
birds of a feather flock together .
