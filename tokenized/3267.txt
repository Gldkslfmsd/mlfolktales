a sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot , and he met a snipe .
" dear friend ," said the snipe , " don ' t shoot my children ?
"" how shall i know your children ?"
asked the sports - man ; " what are they like ?"" oh !"
said the snipe , " mine are the prettiest children in all the wood .
"" very well ," said the sportsman , " i ' ll not shoot them ; don ' t be afraid .
" but for all that , when he came back , there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot ." oh !
oh !"
said the snipe , " why did you shoot my children after all ?
"" what , these your children !"
said the sportsman ; " why , i shot the ugliest i could find , that i did !
"" woe is me !"
said the snipe ; " don ' t you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world ?"
