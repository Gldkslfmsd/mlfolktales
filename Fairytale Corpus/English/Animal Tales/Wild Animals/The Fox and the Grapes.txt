An hungry Fox with fierce attackSprang on a Vine, but tumbled back,Nor could attain the point in view,So near the sky the bunches grew.As he went off, "They're scurvy stuff,"Says he, "and not half ripe enough--And I 've more rev'rence for my tripesThan to torment them with the gripes."For those this tale is very patWho lessen what they can't come at.
