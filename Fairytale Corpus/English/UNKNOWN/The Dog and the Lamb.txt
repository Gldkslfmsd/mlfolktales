A Dog bespoke a sucking Lamb,That used a she-goat as her dam," You little fool, why, how you baa!This goat is not your own mamma :"Then pointed to a distant mead,Where several sheep were put to feed." I ask not," says the Lamb, "for herWho had me first at Nature's spur,And bore me for a time about,Then, like a fardel, threw me out;But her that is content to bilkHer own dear kids, to give me milk."" Yet she that yean'd you sure," says Tray," Should be preferr'd"-- I tell thee nay---Whence could she know that what she hidWas black or white ?-but grant she did--I being thus a male begot'Twas no great favor, since my lotWas hour by hour, throughout my life,To dread the butcher and his knife.Why should I therefore give my voiceFor her who had no pow'r or choiceIn my production, and not cleaveTo her so ready to relieve,When she beheld me left alone,And has such sweet indulgence shown ?"Kind deeds parental love proclaimNot mere necessity and name.
