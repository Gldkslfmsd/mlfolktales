there was once on a time a maiden who was pretty , but idle and negligent .
when she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax , she at once pulled out a whole heap of it , and strewed it about on the ground beside her .
now she had a servant who was industrious , and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away , cleaned them , span them fine , and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself .
a young man had wooed the lazy girl , and the wedding was to take place .
on the eve of the wedding , the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress , and the bride said ,-" ah , how that girl does jump about , dressed in my odds and ends ."
the bridegroom heard that , and asked the bride what she meant by it ?
then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away .
when the bridegroom heard that , and saw how idle she was , and how industrious the poor girl was , he gave her up and went to the other , and chose her as his wife .
