Along the streets Big Elephant was led,To show him off, most likely.Since Elephants are not a common thing to see A crowd of gapers followed on his heels.All of a sudden Pug springs up in front of them.And seeing Elephant, it raises a great rumpus,It lunges, barks and howlsAnd does its best to pick a quarrel.'Hey neighbor, stop the fuss,'A mutt intones, 'You? Deal with Elephant?Look at you barking yourself hoarse, and he just strolls NonplussedAnd doesn't care one bit about your noise.''Ho ho!' Pug says,'That's just what I enjoy,Since I can be a real tough guyWithout a single blow or bruise.That way, the other dogs will say:'To bark at Elephant this PugMust be a real strong mug!'
