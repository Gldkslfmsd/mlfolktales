a boy stole a lesson - book from one of his schoolfellows and took it home to his mother .
she not only abstained from beating him , but encouraged him .
he next time stole a cloak and brought it to her , and she again commended him .
the youth , advanced to adulthood , proceeded to steal things of still greater value .
at last he was caught in the very act , and having his hands bound behind him , was led away to the place of public execution .
his mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in sorrow , whereupon the young man said , " i wish to say something to my mother in her ear ."
she came close to him , and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off .
the mother upbraided him as an unnatural child , whereon he replied , " ah !
if you had beaten me when i first stole and brought to you that lesson - book , i should not have come to this , nor have been thus led to a disgraceful death ."
