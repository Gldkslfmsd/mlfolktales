A Fly that sat upon the beamRated the Mule: " Why, sure you dream ?" Pray get on faster with the cartOr I shall sting you till you smart!"She answers: " All this talk I hearWith small attention, but must fearHim who upon the box sustainsThe pliant whip, and holds the reins.Cease then your pertness-for I knowWhen to give back, and when to go."This tale derides the talking crew,Whose empty threats are all they do.
