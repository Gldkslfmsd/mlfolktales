In Spring, along a waving stalk, a fly Ascending sees set high Above her on a flower, A bee, ensconced as in a bower ; And haughtily remarks : — " A busy state is yours That all the day from morn to eve, duU work endures ! Called to vexatious toil, I might indeed have fainted. Leading, toward labour coy. In paradise, a life of joy, I am with such a care acquainted As flying 'mongst the guests at balls. Where gracefully I publish how my sole connections Are in the town's superior sections. But you should know what glorious feasting to me falls At any rout or birthday party. Whither I surely come the first And eat off dainty porcelain. Next I quench my thirst. Sipping choice wines from crystal, so that I feel hearty. Before the other guests I sate my needs ; with me to try the sweets it rests. I force my way where'er a maid is, Among the youthful beauties mix : Yes, moments of inaction fix On rosy cheek or snowy neck, among the ladies." " All this I know full well," replies the modest bee, " But there have reached me ugly rumours : — You are from folk's affections free. Even at weddings, plague with selfish humours ; And so, if e'er they find you scheming in the home. They drive you forth to roam." " No matter," says the fly, " they cannot my sort smother. Being through one door chased, I enter by another."
