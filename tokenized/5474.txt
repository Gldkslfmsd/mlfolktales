a lion , growing old , lay sick in his cave .
all the beasts came to visit their king , except the fox .
the wolf therefore , thinking that he had a capital opportunity , accused the fox to the lion of not paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit him .
at that very moment the fox came in and heard these last words of the wolf .
the lion roaring out in a rage against him , the fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and said , " and who of all those who have come to you have benefited you so much as i , who have traveled from place to place in every direction , and have sought and learnt from the physicians the means of healing you ?'
the lion commanded him immediately to tell him the cure , when he replied , " you must flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you ."
the wolf was at once taken and flayed ; whereon the fox , turning to him , said with a smile , " you should have moved your master not to ill , but to good , will ."
