Those who will not the forms obeyTo be obliging in their way,Must often punishment abideFor their ill-nature, and their pride.A Grasshopper, in rank ill-will,Was very loud and very shrillAgainst a sapient Owl's repose,Who was compelled by day to dozeWithin a hollow oak's retreat,As wont by night to quest for meat--She is desired to hold her peace.But at the word her cries increase;Again requested to abateHer noise, she's more importunate.The Owl perceiving no redress,And that her words were less and lessAccounted of, no longer pray'd,But thus an artifice essay'd:" Since 'tis impossible to nod,While harping like the Delphian god,You charm our ears, stead of a nap,A batch of nectar will I tap,Which lately from Minerva came;Now if you do not scorn the same,Together let us bumpers ply."The Grasshopper, extremely dry,And, finding she had hit the keyThat gain'd applause, approach'd with glee;At which the Owl upon her flew,And quick the trembling vixen slew.Thus by her death she was adjudgedTo give what in her life she grudged.
