a sparrow had four young ones in a swallow ' s nest .
when they were fledged , some naughty boys pulled out the nest , but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind .
then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world , he had not first warned them of every kind of danger , and given them good instruction how to deal with each .
in the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield , and there the old bird met his four children again , and full of joy took them home with him .
" ah , my dear sons , what pain i have been in about you all through the summer , because you got away in the wind without my teaching ; listen to my words , obey your father , and be well on your guard .
little birds have to encounter great dangers !"
and then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer , and how he had supported himself ?
" i stayed in the gardens , and looked for caterpillars and small worms , until the cherries got ripe ."
- " ah , my son ," said the father , " tit - bits are not bad , but there is great risk about them ; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth , and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top ."
- " yes , father , but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax ?"
said the son .
" where hast thou seen that ?"
- " in a merchant ' s garden ," said the youngster .
" oh , my son , merchant folks are quick folks ," said the father .
" if thou hast been among the children of the world , thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough , only see that thou usest it well , and do not be too confident ."
after this he asked the next , " where hast thou passed thy time ?"
- " at court ," said the son .
" sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place -- there one finds much gold , velvet , silk , armour , harnesses , sparrow - hawks , screech - owls and hen - harriers ; keep to the horses ' stable where they winnow oats , or thresh , and then fortune may give thee thy daily grain of corn in peace ."
- " yes , father ," said the son , " but when the stable - boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw , many a one is caught fast ."
where hast thou seen that ?"
said the old bird .
" at court , among the stable - boys ."
- " oh , my son , court boys are bad boys !
if thou hast been to court and among the lords , and hast left no feathers there , thou hast learnt a fair amount , and wilt know very well how to go about the world , but look around thee and above thee , for the wolves devour the wisest dogs ."
the father examined the third also : " where didst thou seek thy safety ?"
- " i have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart - roads and highways , and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley ."
- " that is indeed dainty fare ," said the father , " but take care what thou art about and look carefully around , especially when thou seest any one stooping and about to pick up a stone , there is not much time to stay then ."
- " that is true ," said the son , " but what if any one should carry a bit of rock , or ore , ready beforehand in his breast or pocket ?"
- " where hast thou seen that ?"
- " among the mountaineers , dear father ; when they go out , they generally take little bits of ore with them ."
- " mountain folks are working folks , and clever folks .
if thou hast been among mountain lads , thou hast seen and learnt something , but when thou goest thither beware , for many a sparrow has been brought to a bad end by a mountain boy ."
at length the father came to the youngest son : " thou , my dear chirping nestling , wert always the silliest and weakest ; stay with me , the world has many rough , wicked birds which have crooked beaks and long claws , and lie in wait for poor little birds and swallow them .
keep with those of thine own kind , and pick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees , or the house , and then thou wilt live long in peace ."
- " my dear father , he who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well , and no sparrow - hawk , eagle , or kite will hurt him if he specially commits himself and his lawful food , evening and morning , faithfully to god , who is the creator and preserver of all forest and village birds , who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young ravens , for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except by his will ."
- " where hast thou learnt this ?"
the son answered , " when the great blast of wind tore me away from thee i came to a church , and there during the summer i have picked up the flies and spiders from the windows , and heard this discourse preached .
the father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through , and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds ."
" in sooth , my dear son , if thou takest refuge in the churches and helpest to clear away spiders and buzzing flies , and criest unto god like the young ravens , and commendest thyself to the eternal creator , all will be well with thee , and that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds ."
" he who to god commits his ways , in silence suffers , waits , and prays , preserves his faith and conscience pure , he is of god ' s protection sure ."
