a man had an ass , and a maltese lapdog , a very great beauty .
the ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat , just as any other ass would .
the lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master , who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat .
the ass , on the contrary , had much work to do in grinding the corn - mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm .
he often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the lapdog , till at last one day he broke his cords and halter , and galloped into his master ' s house , kicking up his heels without measure , and frisking and fawning as well as he could .
he next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the lapdog do , but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms .
he then attempted to lick his master , and jumped upon his back .
the servants , hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master , quickly relieved him , and drove out the ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs .
the ass , as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death , thus lamented : " i have brought it all on myself !
why could i not have been contented to labor with my companions , and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little lapdog !"
