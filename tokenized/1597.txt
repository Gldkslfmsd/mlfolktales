once on a time a poor pious peasant died , and arrived before the gate of heaven .
at the same time a very rich , rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven .
then saint peter came with the key , and opened the door , and let the great man in , but apparently did not see the peasant , and shut the door again .
and now the peasant outside , heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing , and how they were making music , and singing within .
at length all became quiet again , and saint peter came and opened the gate of heaven , and let the peasant in .
the peasant , however , expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also , but all remained quite quiet ; he was received with great affection , it is true , and the angels came to meet him , but no one sang .
then the peasant asked saint peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in , and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth . then said saint peter , " by no means , thou art just as dear to us as any one else , and wilt enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys , but poor fellows like thee come to heaven every day , but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years !"
