The ancients had a legend which told of a certain rat who,weary of the anxieties of this world, retired to a cheese, therein tolive in peace. Profound solitude reigned around the hermit. He worked sohard with his feet and his teeth that in a few days he had a spaciousdwelling and food in plenty. What more could he desire? He thrived well,growing large and fat. Blessings are showered upon those who are vowedto simplicity and renunciation!One day a deputation from Rat-land waited upon him, begging that out ofhis abundance he would grant a slight dole towards fitting out a journeyto a strange country where the rats hoped to get succour in their greatwar against the cat-tribe. Ratopolis was besieged, and owing to thepoverty of the beleaguered republic they were forced to start with emptywallets. They asked but little, believing that in a few days help wouldarrive. "My friends," said the hermit, "earthly affairs no longerconcern me. In what way could a poor recluse assist you? What could hedo but pray for the help you need! My best hopes and wishes you may beassured of." With these words this latest among the saints shut hisdoor.Whom have I in mind, do you think, when I speak of this rat, so sparingof his help? A monk?â€”Oh, no! A dervish rather, for a monk, I suppose,is at all times charitable.
