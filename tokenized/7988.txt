i will , as briefly as i may , the sweets of liberty display . a wolf half famish ' d , chanced to seea dog , as fat as dog could be : for one day meeting on the road , they mutual compliments bestowed :" prithee ," says isgrim , faint and weak ," how came you so well fed and sleek ? i starve , though stronger of the two .""
it will be just as well with you ," the dog quite cool and frank replied ," if with my master you ' ll abide .
"" for what ?"
" why merely to attend , and from night thieves the door defend .""
i gladly will accept the post , what !
shall i bear with snow and frostand all this rough inclement plight , rather than have a home at night , and feed on plenty at my ease ?""
come , then , with me "- the wolf agrees . but as they went the mark he found , where the dog ' s collar had been bound :" what ' s this , my friend ?"
" why , nothing ."
" nay , be more explicit , sir , i pray .""
i ' m somewhat fierce and apt to bite , therefore they hold me pretty tight , that in the day - time i may sleep , and night by night my vigils keep . at eveningtide they let me out , and then i freely walk about : bread comes without a care of mine . i from my master ' s table dine ; the servants throw me many a scrap , with choice of pot - liquor to lap ; so , i ' ve my bellyful , you find .
"" but can you go where you ' ve a mind ?
"" not always , to be flat and plain .
"" then , dog , enjoy your post again , for to remain this servile thing , old isgrim would not be a king ."
