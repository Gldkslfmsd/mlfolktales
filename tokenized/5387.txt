a mouse who always lived on the land , by an unlucky chance formed an intimate acquaintance with a frog , who lived for the most part in the water .
the frog , one day intent on mischief , bound the foot of the mouse tightly to his own .
thus joined together , the frog first of all led his friend the mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their food .
after this , he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived , until reaching the very brink , he suddenly jumped in , dragging the mouse with him .
the frog enjoyed the water amazingly , and swam croaking about , as if he had done a good deed .
the unhappy mouse was soon suffocated by the water , and his dead body floated about on the surface , tied to the foot of the frog .
a hawk observed it , and , pouncing upon it with his talons , carried it aloft .
the frog , being still fastened to the leg of the mouse , was also carried off a prisoner , and was eaten by the hawk .
harm hatch , harm catch .
