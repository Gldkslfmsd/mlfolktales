a dog , crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth , saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another dog , with a piece of meat double his own in size .
he immediately let go of his own , and fiercely attacked the other dog to get his larger piece from him .
he thus lost both : that which he grasped at in the water , because it was a shadow ; and his own , because the stream swept it away .
