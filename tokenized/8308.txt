a crow , holding in his mouth a piece of cheese , stood perched aloft .
a crafty fox who hankered for the cheese deceived the bird with words to this effect : " sir crow thy wings are beautiful , bright and keen thine eye , thy neck a wonder to behold .
an eagle ' s breast thou dost display , and with thy talons over all the beasts thou canst prevail .
so great a bird thou art ; yet mute , alas , and without utterance ."
on hearing this flattery the crow ' s heart was puffed up with conceit , and , dropping the cheese from his mouth , he loudly screamed : " caw !
caw !"
the clever fox pounced on the cheese and tauntingly remarked : " you were not dumb , it seems , you have indeed a voice ; you have everything , sir crow , except brains ."
