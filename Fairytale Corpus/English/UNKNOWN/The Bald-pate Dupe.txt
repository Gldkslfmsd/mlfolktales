Fondling or fondled-any how-(Examples of all times allow)That men by women must be fleeced.A dame, whose years were well increased,But skill'd t' affect a youthful mien,Was a staid husband's empress queen;Who yet sequestered halt his heartFor a young damsel, brisk and smart.They, while each wanted to attachThemselves to him, and seem his match,Began to tamper with his hair.He, pleased with their officious care,Was on a sudden made a coot;For the young strumpet, branch and root,Stripp'd of the hoary hairs his crown,E'en as th' old cat grubb'd up the brown.
