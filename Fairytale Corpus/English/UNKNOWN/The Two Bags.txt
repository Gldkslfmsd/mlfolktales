Great Jove, in his paternal care,Has giv'n a man two Bags to bear;That which his own default containsBehind his back unseen remains;But that which others' vice attestsSwags full in view before our breasts.Hence we're inevitably blind,Relating to the Bag behind;But when our neighbours misdemean,Our censures are exceeding keen.
