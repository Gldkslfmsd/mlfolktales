YOU must know that this ditty.This little romance,Be it dull, be it witty.Arose from mere chance.Near a certain enclosure.Not far from my manse,An Ass with composureWas browsing by chance.As he went along prying.With sober advance,A shepherd's Flute lyingHe found there by chance.Our amateur started,And eyed it askance.Drew nearer and snortedUpon it by chance.The breath of the brute. Sir,Drew music for once;It entered the Flute, Sir,And blew it by chance."Ah!" cried he in wonder,"How comes this to pass?Who will now dare to slanderThe skill of an Ass?"And Asses in plenty,I see at a glanceWill, one time in twenty.Succeed by mere chance.
