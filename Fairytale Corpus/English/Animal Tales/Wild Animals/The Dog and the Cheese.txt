It happened long ago, they say:A dog, crossing a bridge one day,Was clasping with his teeth some cheese.Half way across the bridge, he seesHis cheese's shadow in the stream.Deep in his heart he has this dream:He'd like that second morsel, too.Now there's a greedy dog for you!He jumps right in, opens-his mouth,And as he does, the cheese falls out!Shadow it is, shadow he sees, And that is how he lost his cheese.So therefore people should take heedWho are misguided by their greed.Those who desire more than is justWill be undone by their own lust.They'll lose whatever they had before,And get from others nothing more.
