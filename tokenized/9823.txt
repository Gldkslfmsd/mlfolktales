a town mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country .
for lunch the country mouse served wheat stalks , roots , and acorns , with a dash of cold water for drink .
the town mouse ate very sparingly , nibbling a little of this and a little of that , and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite . after the meal the friends had a long talk , or rather the town mouse talked about her life in the city while the country mouse listened .
they then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning .
in her sleep the country mouse dreamed she was a town mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her .
so the next day when the town mouse asked the country mouse to go home with her to the city , she gladly said yes . when they reached the mansion in which the town mouse lived , they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet .
there were sweetmeats and jellies , pastries , delicious cheeses , indeed , the most tempting foods that a mouse can imagine .
but just as the country mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry , she heard a cat mew loudly and scratch at the door .
in great fear the mice scurried to a hiding place , where they lay quite still for a long time , hardly daring to breathe .
when at last they ventured back to the feast , the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table , followed by the house dog . the country mouse stopped in the town mouse ' s den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella .
" you may have luxuries and dainties that i have not ," she said as she hurried away , " but i prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it .
" poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty .
