the lion , the fox and the ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase .
having secured a large booty , the lion on their return from the forest asked the ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty .
the ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice .
the lion , bursting out into a great rage , devoured the ass .
then he requested the fox to do him the favor to make a division .
the fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel .
the lion said , " who has taught you , my very excellent fellow , the art of division ?
you are perfect to a fraction ."
he replied , " i learned it from the ass , by witnessing his fate ."
happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others .
