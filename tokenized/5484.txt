a half - famished jackdaw seated himself on a fig - tree , which had produced some fruit entirely out of season , and waited in the hope that the figs would ripen .
a fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the reason of his doing so , said to him , " you are indeed , sir , sadly deceiving yourself ; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you , but which will never reward you with enjoyment ."
