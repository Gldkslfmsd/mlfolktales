Whoever, to his honor's cost,His pristine dignity has lost,Is the fool's jest and coward's scorn,When once deserted and forlorn.With years enfeebled and decay'd,A Lion gasping hard was laid:Then came, with furious tusk, a boar,To vindicate his wrongs of yore:The hull was next in hostile spite,With goring horn his foe to smite:At length the ass himself, secureThat now impunity was sure,His blow too insolently deals,And kicks his forehead with his heel.Then thus the Lion, as he died:"'Twas hard to bear the brave," he cried;But to be trampled on by theeIs Nature's last indignity;And thou, 0 despicable thing,Giv'st death at least a double sting."
