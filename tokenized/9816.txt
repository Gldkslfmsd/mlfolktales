a bull , a tup , a cock , and a steg set out together to seek their fortune .
when it got to night , they came to a house , and asked for a night ' s lodging , but the folks said no .
however , at last they were let come into the kitchen .
the bull said he would lie on the floor , the tup said he would lie by his side , the cock would perch on the rannel bank , and the steg would stand at t ' back of the door . at midnight , when all was quiet , two men , meaning to rob the house , were heard parleying outside which should go in , and which watch outside .
one went in , the bull got up and knocked him about , the tup did the same , and the cock said , " fetch him here , i ' ll pick out his eyen .
" so he says , " i ' d best be out of this .
" as he went to the door , the steg took him by the nose with its neb , and beat him with its wings . the other said when he got out , " what have you done ?"" done !"
says he , " the devil knocked me about ; when he ' d done , one of his imps set on .
a thin wi ' glowering eyen said , ' fetch him here ,' etc .
and when i got to the door , a blacksmith took me by the snout with his tongs , and flapped me by the lugs with his leather apron ."
