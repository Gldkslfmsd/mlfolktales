A Man that's gen'rous all at onceMay dupe a novice or a dunce;But to no purpose are the snaresHe for the knowing ones prepares.When late at night a felon triedTo bribe a Dog with food, he cried,"What ho ! do you attempt to stopThe mouth of him that guards the shop?You're mightily mistaken, sir,For this strange kindness is a spur,To make me double all my din,Lest such a scoundrel should come in."
