a wolf who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a crane , for a large sum , to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone .
when the crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment , the wolf , grinning and grinding his teeth , exclaimed : " why , you have surely already had a sufficient recompense , in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf ."
in serving the wicked , expect no reward , and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains .
