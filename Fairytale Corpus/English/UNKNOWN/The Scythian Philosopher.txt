A certain austere philosopher of Scythia, wishing to follow apleasant life, travelled through the land of the Greeks, and there hefound in a quiet spot a sage, one such as Virgil has written of; a manthe equal of kings, the peer almost of the gods, and like them contentand tranquil.The happiness of this sage lay entirely in his beautiful garden. Therethe Scythian found him, pruning hook in hand, cutting away the uselesswood from his fruit trees; lopping here, pruning there, trimming thisand that, and everywhere aiding Nature, who repaid his care with usury."Why this wrecking?" asked the philosopher. "Is it wisdom thus tomutilate these poor dwellers in your garden? Drop that merciless tool,your pruning hook. Leave the work to the scythe of time. He will sendthem, soon enough, to the shores of the river of the departed.""I am taking away the superfluous," answered the sage, "so that what isleft may flourish the better."The Scythian returned to his cheerless abode and, taking a bill-hook,cut and trimmed every hour in the day, advising his neighbours to dolikewise and prescribing to his friends the means and methods. Auniversal cutting-down followed. The handsomest boughs were lopped; hisorchard mutilated beyond all reason. The seasons were disregarded, andneither young moons nor old were noted. In the end everything languishedand died.This Scythian philosopher resembles the indiscriminating Stoic who cutsaway from the soul all passions and desires, good as well as bad, evento the most innocent wishes. For my own part, I protest against suchpeople strongly. They take from the heart its greatest impulses and wecease to live before we are dead.
