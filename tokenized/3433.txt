ingratitude is a nail , which , driven into the tree of courtesy , causes it to wither .
it is a broken channel by which the foundations of affection are undermined ; and a lump of soot , which , falling into the dish of friendship , destroys its scent and savour -- as is seen in daily instances , and , amongst others , in the story which i will now tell you . there was one time in my dear city of naples an old man who was as poor as poor could be .
he was so wretched , so bare , so light , and with not a farthing in his pocket , that he went naked as a flea .
and being about to shake out the bags of life , he called to him his sons , oratiello and pippo , and said to them , " i am now called upon by the tenor of my bill to pay the debt i owe to nature .
believe me , i should feel great pleasure in quitting this abode of misery , this den of woes , but that i leave you here behind me -- a pair of miserable fellows , as big as a church , without a stitch upon your backs , as clean as a barber ' s basin , as nimble as a serjeant , as dry as a plum - stone , without so much as a fly can carry upon its foot ; so that , were you to run a hundred miles , not a farthing would drop from you .
my ill - fortune has indeed brought me to such beggary that i lead the life of a dog , for i have all along , as well you know , gaped with hunger and gone to bed without a candle .
nevertheless , now that i am a - dying , i wish to leave you some token of my love .
so do you , oratiello , who are my first - born , take the sieve that hangs yonder against the wall , with which you can earn your bread ; and do you , little fellow , take the cat and remember your daddy !"
so saying , he began to whimper ; and presently after said , " god be with you -- for it is night !
" oratiello had his father buried by charity ; and then took the sieve and went riddling here , there , and everywhere to gain a livelihood ; and the more he riddled , the more he earned .
but pippo , taking the cat , said , " only see now what a pretty legacy my father has left me !
i , who am not able to support myself , must now provide for two .
whoever beheld so miserable an inheritance ?"
then the cat , who overheard this lamentation , said to him , " you are grieving without need , and have more luck than sense .
you little know the good fortune in store for you ; and that i am able to make you rich if i set about it ."
when pippo had heard this , he thanked her pussyship , stroked her three or four times on the back , and commended himself warmly to her .
so the cat took compassion on poor pippo ; and , every morning , when the sun , with the bait of light on his golden hook , fishes for the shakes of night , she betook herself to the shore , and catching a goodly grey mullet or a fine dory , she carried it to the king and said , " my lord pippo , your majesty ' s most humble slave , sends you this fish with all reverence , and says , a small present to a great lord .'"
then the king , with a joyful face , as one usually shows to those who bring a gift , answered the cat , " tell this lord , whom i do not know , that i thank him heartily .
" again , the cat would run to the marshes or the fields , and when the fowlers had brought down a blackbird , a snipe , or a lark , she caught it up and presented it to the king with the same message .
she repeated this trick again and again , until one morning the king said to her , " i feel infinitely obliged to this lord pippo , and am desirous of knowing him , that i may make a return for the kindness he has shown me ."
and the cat replied , " the desire of my lord pippo is to give his life for your majesty ' s crown ; and tomorrow morning , without fail , as soon as the sun has set fire to the stubble of the fields of air , he will come and pay his respects to you .
" so when the morning came , the cat went to the king , and said to him : " sire , my lord pippo sends to excuse himself for not coming , as last night some of his servants robbed him and ran off , and have not left him a single shirt to his back ."
when the king heard this , he instantly commanded his retainers to take out of his own wardrobe a quantity of clothes and linen , and sent them to pippo ; and , before two hours had passed , pippo went to the palace , conducted by the cat , where he received a thousand compliments from the king , who made him sit beside himself , and gave him a banquet that would amaze you . while they were eating , pippo from time to time turned to the cat and said to her , " my pretty puss , pray take care that those rags don ' t slip through our fingers ."
then the cat answered , " be quiet , be quiet ; don ' t be talking of these beggarly things ."
the king , wishing to know the subject of their talk , the cat made answer that pippo had taken a fancy to a small lemon ; whereupon the king instantly sent out to the garden for a basketful .
but pippo returned to the same tune about the old coats and shirts , and the cat again told him to hold his tongue .
then the king once more asked what was the matter , and the cat had another excuse to make amends for pippo ' s rudeness . at last , when they had eaten and conversed for some time about one thing and another , pippo took his leave ; and the cat stayed with the king , describing the worth , the wisdom , and the judgment of pippo ; and , above all , the great wealth he had in the plains of rome and lombardy , which well entitled him to marry even into the family of a crowned king .
then the king asked what might be his fortune ; and the cat replied that no one could ever count the moveables , the fixtures , and the household furniture of this rich man , who did not even know what he possessed .
if the king wished to be informed of it , he had only to send messengers with the cat , and she would prove to him that there was no wealth in the world equal to his . then the king called some trusty persons , and commanded them to inform themselves minutely of the truth ; so they followed in the footsteps of the cat , who , as soon as they had passed the frontier of the kingdom , from time to time ran on before , under the pretext of providing refreshments for them on the road .
whenever she met a flock of sheep , a herd of cows , a troop of horses , or a drove of pigs , she would say to the herdsmen and keepers , " ho !
have a care !
a troop of robbers is coming to carry off everything in the country .
so if you wish to escape their fury , and to have your things respected , say that they all belong to the lord pippo , and not a hair will be touched .
" she said the same at all the farmhouses , so that wherever the king ' s people came they found the pipe tuned ; for everything they met with , they were told , belonged to the lord pippo .
at last they were tired of asking , and returned to the king , telling seas and mountains of the riches of lord pippo .
the king , hearing this report , promised the cat a good drink if she should manage to bring about the match ; and the cat , playing the shuttle between them , at last concluded the marriage .
so pippo came , and the king gave him his daughter and a large portion . at the end of a month of festivities , pippo wished to take his bride to his estates , so the king accompanied them as far as the frontiers ; and he went on to lombardy , where , by the cat ' s advice , he purchased a large estate and became a baron . pippo , seeing himself now so rich , thanked the cat more than words can express , saying that he owed his life and his greatness to her good offices ; and that the ingenuity of a cat had done more for him that the wit of his father .
therefore , said he , she might dispose of his life and his property as she pleased ; and he gave her his word that when she died , which he prayed might not be for a hundred years , he would have her embalmed and put into a golden coffin , and set in his own chamber , that he might keep her memory always before his eyes . the cat listened to these lavish professions ; and before three days she pretended to be dead , and stretched herself at full length in the garden .
when pippo ' s wife saw her , she cried out , " oh , husband , what a sad misfortune !
the cat is dead !"
" devil die with her !"
said pippo .
" better her than we !"
" what shall we do with her ?"
replied the wife .
" take her by the leg ," said he , " and fling her out of the window !
" then the cat , who heard this fine reward when she least expected it , began to say , " is this the return you make for my taking you from beggary ?
are these the thanks i get for freeing you from rags that you might have hung distaffs with ?
is this my reward for having put good clothes on your back when you were a poor , starved , miserable , tatter - shod ragamuffin ?
but such is the fate of him who washes an ass ' s head !
go !
a curse upon all i have done for you !
a fine gold coffin you had prepared for me !
a fine funeral you were going to give me !
go , now !
serve , labour , toil , sweat to get this fine reward !
unhappy is he who does a good deed in hope of a return .
well was it said by the philosopher , he who lies down an ass , an ass he finds himself .'
but let him who does most , expect least ; smooth words and ill deeds deceive alike both fools and wise !
" so saying , she drew her cloak about her and went her way .
all that pippo , with the utmost humility , could do to soothe her was of no avail .
she would not return ; but ran on and on without ever turning her head about , saying --" heaven keep me from the rich grown poor , and from the beggar who of wealth gains store ."
