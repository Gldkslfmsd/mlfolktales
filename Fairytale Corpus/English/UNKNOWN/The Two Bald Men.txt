As on his way a Bald-pate went,He found a comb by accident;Another, with a head as bare,Pursued, and hollow'd for a share.The first produced the prize, and cried," Good Providence was on our side;But by the strange caprice of Fate,We 're to no purpose fortunate;And, as the proverb says, have foundA hobnail, for a hundred pound."They by this tale may be relievedWhose sanguine hopes have been deceived.
