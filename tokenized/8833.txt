it happened long ago , they say : a dog , crossing a bridge one day , was clasping with his teeth some cheese . half way across the bridge , he seeshis cheese ' s shadow in the stream . deep in his heart he has this dream : he ' d like that second morsel , too . now there ' s a greedy dog for you ! he jumps right in , opens - his mouth , and as he does , the cheese falls out ! shadow it is , shadow he sees , and that is how he lost his cheese . so therefore people should take heedwho are misguided by their greed . those who desire more than is justwill be undone by their own lust . they ' ll lose whatever they had before , and get from others nothing more .
