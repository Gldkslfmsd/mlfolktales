A Dog, while scratching up the ground,'Mongst human bones a treasure found;But as his sacrilege was great,To covet riches was his fate,And punishment of his offence;He therefore never stirr'd from thence,But both in hunger and the cold,With anxious care he watch'd the gold,Till wholly negligent of food,A ling'ring death at length ensued.Upon his corse a Vulture stood,And thus descanted :-" It is good,O Dog, that there thou liest bereavedWho in the highway wast conceived,And on a scurvy dunghill bred,Hadst royal riches in thy head."
