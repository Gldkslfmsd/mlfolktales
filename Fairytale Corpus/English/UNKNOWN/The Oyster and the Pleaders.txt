One day two pilgrims espied upon the sands of the shore anoyster that had been thrown up by the tide. They devoured it with theireyes whilst pointing at it with their fingers; but whose teeth shoulddeal with it was a matter of dispute.When one stopped to pick up the prey the other pushed him away saying:"It would be just as well first to decide which of us is to have thepleasure of it. He who first saw it should swallow it, and let the otherwatch him eat.""If you settle the affair that way," replied his companion, "I have goodeyes, thank God.""But my sight is not bad either," said the other, "and I saw it beforeyou did, and that I'll stake my life upon.""Well, suppose you did see it, I smelt it."During this lively interlude Justice Nincompoop arrived on the scene,and to him they appealed to judge their claims. The justice very gravelytook the oyster, opened it, and put it into his mouth, whilst the twoclaimants looked on. Having deliberately swallowed the oyster, thejustice, in the portentous tones of a Lord Chief Justice, said, "Thecourt here awards each of you a shell, without costs. Let each go homepeaceably."Reckon what it costs to go to law in these days. Then count what remainsto most families. You will see that Justice Nincompoop draws all themoney and leaves only the empty purse and the shells to the litigants.Deliberately swallowed the oyster.
