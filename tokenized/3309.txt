once on a time there was a little boy who was out walking on the road , and when he had walked a bit he found a box .
' i am sure there must be something pretty in this box ,' he said to himself ; but however much he turned it , and however much he twisted it , he was not able to get it open . but when he had walked a bit farther , he found a little tiny key .
then he got tired and sat down , and all at once he thought what fun it would be if the key fitted the box , for it had a little key - hole in it .
so he took the little key out of his pocket , and then he blew first into the pipe of the key , and afterwards into the key - hole , and then he put the key into the key - hole and turned it .
' snap ' it went within the lock ; and when he tried the hasp , the box was open . but can you guess what there was in the box ?
why a cow ' s tail ; and if the cow ' s tail had been longer , this story would have been longer too .
