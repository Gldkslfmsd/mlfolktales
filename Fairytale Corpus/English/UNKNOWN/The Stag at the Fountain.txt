FULL often what you now despiseProves better than the things you prize;Let Esop's narrative decide:A Stag beheld, with conscious pride,(As at the fountain-head he stood)His image in the silver flood,And there extols his branching horns,While his poor spindle-shanks he scorns-But, lo! he hears the hunter's cries,And, frightened, o'er the champaign flies--His swiftness baffles the pursuit:At length a wood receives the brute,And by his horns entangled there,The pack began his flesh to tear:Then dying thus he wail'd his fate:"Unhappy me! and wise too late!How useful what I did disdain!How grievous that which made me vain!
