With his suite the Tsar departed.The Tsaritsa tender-heartedAt the window sat alone,Wishing he would hurry home.All day every day she waited,Gazing till her dedicatedEyes grew weak from overstrain,Gazing at the empty plain,Not a sign of her beloved!Nothing but the snowflakes hurriedHeaping drifts upon the lea.Earth was white as white could be.Nine long months she sat and waited,Kept her vigil unabated.Then from God on Christmas EveShe a daughter did receive.Next day early in the morning,Love and loyalty rewarding,Home again from travel farCame at last the father-Tsar.One fond glance at him she darted,Gasped for joy with thin lips parted,Then fell back upon her bedAnd by prayer-time was dead.Long the Tsar sat lonely, brooding.But he, too, was only human.Tears for one sad year he shed...And another woman wed.She (if one be strictly truthful)Was a born Tsaritsa?youthful,Slim, tall, fair to look upon,Clever, witty?and so on.But she was in equal measureStubborn, haughty, wilful, jealous.In her dowry rich and vastWas a little looking-glass.It had this unique distinction:It could speak with perfect diction.Only with this glass would sheIn a pleasant humour be.Many times a day she'd greet itAnd coquettishly entreat it:"Tell me, pretty looking-glass,Nothing but the truth, I ask:Who in all the world is fairestAnd has beauty of the rarest?"And the looking-glass replied:"You, it cannot be denied.You in all the world are fairestAnd your beauty is the rarest."The Tsaritsa laughed with glee,Shrugged her shoulders merrily,Puffed her cheeks and bat her eyelids,Flicked her fingers coyly, slyly,Pranced around with hand on hips,Arrogance upon her lips.All this time the Tsar's own daughterQuietly, as Nature taught her,Grew and grew, and came quite soonLike a flower into bloom:Raven-browed, of fair complexion,Breathing kindness and affection.And the choice of fianceLighted on Prince Yelisei.Suit was made. The Tsar consentedAnd her dowry was indented:Seven towns with wealthy store,Mansion-houses ? sevenscore.On the night before the weddingFor a bridal party dressingThe Tsaritsa, time to pass,Chatted with her looking-glass:"Who in all the world is fairestAnd has beauty of the rarest?"Then what did the glass reply?"You are fair, I can't deny.But the Princess is the fairestAnd her beauty is the rarest."Up the proud Tsaritsa jumped.On the table how she thumped,Angrily the mirror slapping,Slipper heel in fury tapping!"O you loathsome looking-glass,Telling lies as bold as brass!By what right is she my rival?Such young folly I shall bridle.So she's grown up?me to spite!Little wonder she's so white:With her bulging mother gazingAt that snow?what's so amazing!Now look here, explain to meHow can she the fairer be?Scour this realm of ours and seek well,Nowhere shall you find my equal.Is not that the truth?" she cried.Still the looking-glass replied:"But the Princess is the fairestAnd her beauty is the rarest."The Tsaritsa burst with spite,Hurled the mirror out of sightUnderneath the nearest cupboard,And when breath she had recoveredSummoned Smudge, her chamber maid,And to her instructions gave:"Take the Princess to the forest,Bind her hand and foot and foreheadTo a tree! When wolves arriveLet them eat the girl alive!"Woman's wrath would daunt the devil!Protest was no use whatever.Soon the Princess left with SmudgeFor the woods. So far they trudgedThat the Princess guessed the reason.Scared to death by such foul treason,Loud she pleaded: "Spare my life!Innocent of guilt am I!Do not kill me, I beseech you!And when I become TsaritsaI shall give you rich reward."Smudge, who really loved her ward,Being loth to kill or bind her,Let her go, remarking kindly:"God be with you! Do not moan!"And, this said, went back alone."Well?" demanded the Tsaritsa,"Where's that pretty little creature?""In the forest on her own,"Smudge replied. "And there she'll stay.To a tree I firmly lashed her.When a hungry beast attacks herShe'll have little time to cryAnd the quicker she shall die!"Rumour spread and caused a panic:"What, the Tsar's own daughter vanished!"Mournful was the Tsar that day.But the young Prince YeliseiOffered God a fervent prayerAnd departed then and thereTo seek out and homeward guideHis sweet-tempered, youthful bride.Meanwhile his young bride kept walkingThrough the forest until morning,Vague as to her whereabouts.Suddenly she spied a house.Out a dog ran growling, yapping,Then sat down, his tail tap-tapping.At the gate there was no guard.All was quiet in the yard.Close at heel the good dog boundedAs the Princess slowly mountedStairs to gain the living floor,Turned the ring upon the door.Silently the door swung openAnd before her eyes unfoldedA bright chamber: all aroundBenches strewn with rugs she found,Board of oak beneath the ikonAnd a stove with tiles to lie on.To the Princess it was clearKindly folk were dwelling hereWho would not deny her shelter.No one was at home, however.So she set to, cleaned the pans,Made the whole house spick and span,Lit a candle in the corner,Fed the fire to be warmer,Climbed onto the platform bedThere to lay her sleepy head.Dinner time. The yard resounded,Horses stamped and men dismounted.Thick-moustached and ruddy-skinned,Seven lusty Knights walked in.Said the Eldest: "How amazing!All so neat! The fire blazing!Somebody's been cleaning hereAnd is waiting somewhere near.Who is there? Come out of hiding!Be a friend in peace abiding!If you're someone old and hoar,Be our uncle evermore!If you're young and love a scuffle.We'll embrace you as a brother.If a venerable dame,Then shall 'mother' be your name.If a maiden fair, we'll call youOur dear sister and adore you."So the Princess rose, came downTo the Seven Knights and bowed,Her good wishes emphasising,Blushing and apologisingThat to their delightful homeUninvited she had come.Straight they saw her speech bore witnessTo the presence of a Princess.So they cleared a corner seat,Offered her a pie with meat,Filled a glass with wine and served itOn a tray, as she deserved it.But the glass of heady wineShe politely did declineAnd the pie she broke with caution,Savouring a tiny portion.Pleading she was very tired,Soon she gracefully retiredAnd the Seven Knights conveyed herTo the best and brightest chamberAnd, away as they did creep,She was falling fast asleep.Days flew by?the Princess livingAll the time without misgivingIn the forest, never boredWith the Seven Knights abroad.Darkness would the earth still coverWhen at dawn the seven brothersWould ride out to try their luckWith a long-bow, shooting duck,Or to ply their sword in battleAnd a Saracen unsaddle,Headlong at a Tartar go,Chop his head off at a blow,Or give chase to a Circassian,From the forest send him dashing.She, as lady of the house,Rose much later, moved aboutDusting, polishing and cooking,Never once the Knights rebuking.They, too, never chided her.Days flew by like gossamer.And in time they grew to love her.Thereupon all seven brothersShortly after dawn one dayTo her chamber made their wayAnd the Eldest Knight addressed her:"As you know, you are our sister.But all seven of us hereAre in love with you, my dear,And we all desire your favours.But that must not be. God save us!Find some way to give us peace!Be a wife to one at least,To the rest remain a sister!But you shake your head. Is this toSay our offer you refuse?Nothing from our stock you'll choose?""O my brave and bonny brothers,Virtuous beyond all others!"In reply the Princess'said,"God in heaven strike me deadIf my answer be not honest:I've no choice?my hand is promised!You're all equal in my eyes,All so valiant and wise,And I love you all, dear brothers!But my heart is to anotherPledged for evermore. One dayI shall wed Prince Yelisei!"Hushed, the brothers kept their station,Scratched their foreheads in frustration."As you wish! So now we know,"Said the Eldest with a bow."Pray forgive us?and I promiseYou'll hear nothing further from us!""I'm not angry," she replied."By my pledge I must abide."Bowing low, the seven suitorsLeft her room with passions muted.So in harmony againDid they live and friendship reign.The Tsaritsa was still lividEvery time she saw in vividMemory the Princess fair.Long the mirror, lying there,Was the object of her hatred;But at last her wrath abated.So one day it came to passThat she took the looking-glassUp again and sat before it,Smiled and, as before, implored it:"Greetings, pretty looking-glass!Tell me all the truth, I ask:Who in all the world is fairestAnd has beauty of the rarest?"Said the mirror in reply:"You are fair, I can't deny.But where Seven Knights go ridingIn a green oak-grove residingHumbly lives a person whoIs more beautiful than you."The Tsaritsa's wrath descendedOn her maid: "What folly temptedYou to lie? You disobeyed!"Smudge a full confession made...Uttering a threat of torture,The Tsaritsa grimly swore toSend the Princess to her deathOr not draw another breath.One day by her window waitingFor her brothers homeward hastingSat the young Princess and span.Suddenly the dog beganBarking. Through the courtyard scurriedA poor beggar-woman, worriedBy the dog she kept at bayWith her stick. "Don't go away!Stay there, stay!" the Princess shouted,From the window leaning outward."Let me call the dog to heelAnd I'll offer you a meal."And the beggar-woman answered:"Pretty child, you take my fancy!For that dog of yours, you see,Could well be the death of me.See him snarling, bristling yonder!Come here, child!" The Princess wantedTo go out, and took a loaf.But the dog its body woveRound her feet, refused to let herStep towards the woman-beggar.When the woman, too, drew near,Wilder than an angry bearIt attacked her. How perplexing!"Had a bad night's sleep, I reckon!"Said the Princess. "Catch it! There!"And the bread flew through the air.The poor beggar-woman caught it."I most humbly thank you, daughter,God be merciful!" said she."In return take this from me!"The bright apple she was holding,Newly picked, fresh, ripe and golden,Straight towards the Princess flew...How the dog leapt in pursuit!But the Princess neatly trapped itIn her palms. "Enjoy the appleAt you leisure, little pet!Thank you for the loaf of bread..."Said the beggar-woman, brandishedIn the air her stick and vanished...Up the stairs the Princess ranWith the dog, which then beganPitifully staring, whiningJust as if its heart were piningFor the gift of speech to say:"Throw that apple far away!"Hastily his neck she patted:"Hey, Sokolko, what's the matter?Lie down!" Entering once moreHer own room, she shut the door,Sat there with her spindle humming,Waiting for her brothers' coming.But she could not take her gazeFrom the apple where it layFull of fragrance, rosy, glowing,Fresh and juicy, ripe and golden,Sweet as honey to the lips!She could even see the pips...First the Princess thought of waitingUntil dinner. But temptationProved too strong. She grasped the brightApple, took a stealthy biteAnd with fair cheek sweetly hollowedA delicious morsel swallowed.All at once her breathing stopped,Listlessly her white arms dropped.From her lap the rosy appleTumbled to the floor. The haplessMaiden closed her swooning eyes,Reeled and fell without a cry,On the bench her forehead striking,Then lay still beneath the ikon...Now the brothers, as it chanced,Were returning in a bandFrom another warlike foray.Out to meet them in the forestWent the dog and, running hard,Led them straight into the yard.Said the Knights: "An evil omen!Grief in store!" The door they opened,Walked into the room and gasped.But the dog like lightning dashedFor the apple and devoured it.Death that instant overpowered it.For the apple was, they saw,Filled with poison to the core.By the dead Princess the brothersBent their heads in tears and utteredHoly prayer to save her soul;Nothing could their grief console.From the bench they raised her, dressed her,Wished within a grave to rest her,Then had second thoughts. For sheWas as rosy as if sleepGarlands of repose were wreathingRound her?though she was not breathing.Three whole days they waited, butStill her eyes were tightly shut.So that night with solemn ritualIn a coffin made of crystalThey laid out the body fairOf the Princess and from thereTo a hollow mountain bore her,Where a tomb they fashioned for her:Iron chains they used to fixHer glass case to pillars sixWith due caution, and erectedIron railings to protect it.Then the Eldest smote his breastAnd the dead Princess addressed:"Ever peaceful be your slumber!Though your days were few in numberOn this earth?spite took its toll?Yet shall heaven have your soul.With pure love did we regard you,For your loved one did we guard you,But you came not to the groom,Only to a chill dark tomb."That same day the bad Tsaritsa,Waiting for good news to reach her,Secretly the mirror tookAnd her usual question put:"Who is now by far the fairestAnd has beauty of the rarest?"And the answer satisfied:"You, it cannot be denied.You in all the world are fairestAnd your beauty is the rarest!"In pursuit of his sweet brideThrough the country far and wideStill Prince Yelisei goes riding,Weeping bitterly. No tidings!For no matter whom he asksPeople either turn their backsOr most rudely rock with laughter:No one knows what he is after.Now to the bright Sun in zealDid the bold young Prince appeal:"Sun, dear Sun! The whole year coursingThrough the sky, in springtime thawingFrom the chill earth winter snow!You observe us all below.Surely you'll not grudge an answer?Tell me, did you ever chance toSee the Princess I revere?I'm her fiance." "My dear,"Said the Sun with some insistence,"I have nowhere seen your Princess,So she's dead, we must presume,That is, if my friend, the Moon,Has not met her on his travelsOr seen clues you may unravel."Through the dark night Yelisei,Feeling anything but gay,With a lover's perseveranceWaited for the Moon's appearance."Moon, O Moon, my friend!" he said,"Gold of horn and round of head,From the darkest shadows rising,With your eye the world apprising,You whom stars with love regardAs you mount your nightly guard!Surely you'll not grudge an answer?Tell me, did you ever chance toSee the Princess I revere?I'm her fiance." "O dear!"Said the Moon in consternation,"No, I have not seen the maiden.On my round I only goWhen it is my turn, you know.It would seem that I was restingWhen she passed." "How very vexing!"Cried aloud Prince Yelisei.But the Moon went on to say:"Wait a minute! I suggest youHave the Wind come to the rescue.Call him now! It's worth a try.And cheer up a bit! Goodbye!"Yelisei, not losing courage,To the Wind's abode now hurried."Wind, O Wind! Lord of the sky,Herding flocks of clouds on high,Stirring up the dark-blue ocean,Setting all the air in motion,Unafraid of anyoneSaving God in heaven alone!Surely you'll not grudge an answer?Tell me, did you ever chance toSee the Princess I revere?I'm her fiance." "O hear!"Said the Wind in turmoil blowing."Where a quiet stream is flowingStands a mountain high and steepIn it lies a cavern deep;In this cave in shadows dismalSways a coffin, made of crystal.Hung by chains from pillars six.Round it barren land in whichNo man ever meets another.In that tomb your bride discover!"With a howl the Wind was gone.Yelisei wept loud and long.To the barren land he journeyedDesperately, sadly yearningOnce again to see his bride.On he rode. A mountain highRose before him, soaring steeplyFrom a land laid waste completely.At its foot?an entrance dim.Yelisei went quickly in.There, he saw, in shadows dismalSwayed a coffin made of crystalWhere the Princess lay at restIn the deep sleep of the blest.And the Prince in tears dissolvingThrew himself upon the coffin...And it broke! The maiden straightCame to life, sat up, in greatWonder looked about and yawningAs she set her bed see-sawingSaid with pretty arms outstretched:"Gracious me! How long I've slept!"Down she stepped from out the coffin.O the sighing and the sobbing!Carrying his bride, he strodeBack to daylight. Home they rode,Making pleasant conversationTill they reached their destination.Swiftly rumour spread around:"The Princess is safe and sound!"It so happened the TsaritsaIn her room was idly seatedBy her magic looking-glassAnd to pass the time did ask:"Who in all the world is fairestAnd has beauty of the rarest?"Said the mirror in reply:"You are fair, I can't deny,But the Princess is the fairestAnd her beauty is the rarest!"The Tsaritsa leapt and smashedOn the floor her looking-glass,Rushing to the door she saw theFair young Princess walk towards her.Overcome by grief and spite,The Tsaritsa died that night.From the grave where she was buriedTo a wedding people hurried,For the good Prince YeliseiWed his Princess that same day.Never since the World's creationWas there such a celebration;I was there, drank mead and yetBarely got my whiskers wet.
