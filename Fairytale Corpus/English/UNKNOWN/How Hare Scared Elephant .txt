Hare once said to Elephant : " Let us play hide-and-seek and we will see who is the more cunning at the game." Elephant replied : " I have more cunning than you in hiding ; a little thing like you cannot be more cunning than I." So they went off. When they arrived at the place. Hare said to Elephant : " You be the first to hide." Elephant went off, and coming to a bush he hid ; at least he thought he hid, really he was lying in the open. He called out : " I am hidden." Hare on his arrival at once found him. Then Hare on his part said : " Stay here, while I hide." He lay down at the bush, turned on his back and protruded his eyes ; then he called Elephant : " Come and find me." Elephant came, and hunted about. Said he : " Wherever can you be ? " Then, looking down, he saw the protruded eyes, and was amazed. " The earth horrifies me," he said, " it grows eyes." Then he called his friends, saying : " Come and see here, the earth grows eyes." They came and Hare arose and said to Elephant : " You are a fool. I have more cunning than you. I am the great one." Elephant was simply crestfallen.
