the ants were spending a fine winter ' s day drying grain collected in the summertime .
a grasshopper , perishing with famine , passed by and earnestly begged for a little food .
the ants inquired of him , " why did you not treasure up food during the summer ?'
he replied , " i had not leisure enough .
i passed the days in singing ."
they then said in derision : " if you were foolish enough to sing all the summer , you must dance supperless to bed in the winter ."
