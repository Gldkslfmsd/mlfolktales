there was a young herdsman who wanted very much to marry , and was acquainted with three sisters .
each one was just as beautiful as the other , so it was difficult for him to make a choice , and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them .
then he asked his mother for advice , and she said , " invite all three , and set some cheese before them , and watch how they cut off a slice .
" the youth did so .
the first one ate the cheese with the rind on .
the second one hastily cut the rind off the cheese , but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it , and threw that away also .
the third peeled the rind off carefully , and cut neither too much nor too little .
the shepherd told all this to his mother , who said , " take the third for your wife .
" this he did , and lived contentedly and happily with her .
