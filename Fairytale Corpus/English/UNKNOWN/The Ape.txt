There is an ape in Paris to whom a wife was once given; and he,imitating many another husband, beat the poor creature to such an extentthat she sighed all the breath out of her body and died.Their son uttered the most doleful howls as a protest to this terriblebusiness.The father laughs now. His wife is dead and he already has found otherlady companions, whom, no doubt, he beats in the same way; for he hauntsthe taverns and is frequently tipsy.Never expect anything good from people who imitate, whether they be apesor authors. Of the two the worst kind is the imitating author.
