A Bull was struggling to secureHis passage at a narrow door,And scarce could reach the rack of hay,His horns so much were in his way.A Calf officious, fain would showHow he might twist himself and go."Hold thou thy prate; all this," says he,Ere thou wert calved was known to me."He, that a wiser man by halfWould teach, may think himself this Calf.
