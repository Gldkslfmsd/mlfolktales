a fox caught in a trap escaped , but in so doing lost his tail .
thereafter , feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed , he schemed to convince all the other foxes that being tailless was much more attractive , thus making up for his own deprivation .
he assembled a good many foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails , saying that they would not only look much better without them , but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush , which was a very great inconvenience .
one of them interrupting him said , " if you had not yourself lost your tail , my friend , you would not thus counsel us ."
