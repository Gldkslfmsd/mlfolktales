once on a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wife .
amongst other places he came to a farm - house , where the household were little better than beggars ; but when the wooer came in they wanted to make out that they were well to do , as you may guess .
now the husband had got a new arm to his coat .
" pray , take a seat ," he said to the wooer ; " but there ' s a shocking dust in the house .
" so he went about rubbing and wiping all the benches and tables with his new arm , but he kept the other all the while behind his back . the wife she had got one new shoe , and she went stamping and sliding with it up against the stools and chairs , saying , " how untidy it is here !
everything is out of its place !
" then they called out to their daughter to come down and put things to rights ; but the daughter she had got a new cap ; so she put her head in at the door , and kept nodding and nodding , first to this side , and then to that ." well !
for my part ," she said , " i can ' t be everywhere at once ." ay !
ay !
that was a well - to - do household the wooer had come to .
