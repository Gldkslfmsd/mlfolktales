Story ID (from ATU-website): 5449
ATU Classification Number: UNKNOWN

  A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large leaves of a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the place of his concealment. Supposing all danger to have passed, the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves, looked back, and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow from his bow and struck it.  The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: "I am rightly served, for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me."
