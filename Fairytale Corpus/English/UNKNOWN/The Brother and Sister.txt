Warn'd by our council, oft beware,And look into yourself with care.There was a certain father hadA homely girl and comely lad.These being at their childish playWithin their mother's room one day,A looking-glass was in the chair,And they beheld their faces there.The boy grows prouder as he looks;The girl is in a rage, nor brooksHer boasting brother's jests and sneers,Affronted at each word she hears:Then to her father down she flies,Arid urges all she can deviseAgainst the boy, who could presumeTo meddle in a lady's room.At which, embracing each in turn,With most affectionate concern," My dears," he says, " ye may not passA day without this useful glass;You, lest you spoil a pretty face,By doing things to your disgrace;You, by good conduct to correctYour form, and beautify defect."
