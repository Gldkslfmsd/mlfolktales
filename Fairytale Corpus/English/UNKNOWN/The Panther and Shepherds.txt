Their scorn comes home to them againWho treat the wretched with disdain.A careless Panther long agoFell in a pit, which overthrowThe Shepherds all around alarm'd;When some themselves with cudgels arm'd;Others threw stones upon its head;But some in pity sent her bread,As death was not the creature's due.The night came on - the hostile crewWent home, not doubting in the wayTo find the Panther dead next day.But she, recovering of her strength,Sprang from the pit and fled at length.But rushing in a little spaceFrom forth her den upon the place,She tears the flock, the Shepherd slays,And all the region round dismays.Then they began to be afraidWho spared the beast and lent their aid;They reck not of the loss, but makeTheir pray'r for life, when thus she spake:"I well remember them that threwThe stones, and well remember youWho gave me bread -- desist to fear,For 'twas the oppressor brought me here."
