"What have I done to be treated in this way? Mutilated by myown master! A nice state to be in! Dare I present myself before otherdogs? O ye kings over the animals, or rather tyrants of them, would anycreature do the same to you?"Such were the lamentations of poor Fido, a young house-dog, whilst thosewho were busy cropping his ears remained quite untouched by his piercingand dolorous howls.Fido believed himself to be ruined for life; but he very shortly foundthat he was a gainer by the maiming. For being by nature disposed topilfer from his companions, it would come within his experience to havemany misadventures wherein his ears would be torn in a hundred places.Aggressive dogs always have ragged ears. The less they have for otherdogs' teeth to fasten upon the better.When one has but a single weak place to defend, one protects it againstan onset. Witness Master Fido armed with a spiked collar, and having nomore ears to catch hold of than are on my hand. Even a wolf would nothave known where to take him.
