Bald, naked, of a human shape,With fleet wings ready to escape,Upon a razor's edge his toes,And lock that on his forehead grows-Him hold, when seized, for goodness' sakeFor Jove himself cannot retakeThe fugitive when once he's gone.The picture that we here have drawnIs Opportunity so brief.-The ancients, in a bas-relief,Thus made an effigy of Time,That every one might use their prime;Nor e'er impede, by dull delay,Th' effectual business of to-day.
