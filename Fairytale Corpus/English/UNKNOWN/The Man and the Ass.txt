A certain Man, when he had madeA sacrifice, for special aidTo Hercules, and killed a swine,Did for his Ass's share assignAll the remainder of the corn;But he, rejecting it with scorn,Thus said: "I gladly would partake-But apprehend that life's at stake;For he you fatted up and fedWith store of this, is stuck and dead."Struck with the import of this tale,I have succeeded to prevailUpon my passions, and abstain,From peril of immod'rate gain.But, you will say, those that have comeUnjustly by a handsome sum,Upon the pillage still subsist-Why, if we reckon up the list,You'll find by far the major partHave been conducted in the cart:Temerity for some may do,But many more their rashness rue.
