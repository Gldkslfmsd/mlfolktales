Everything to do with love is mystery. Cupid's arrows, hisquiver, his torch, his boyhood: it is more than a day's work to exhaustthis science. I make no pretence here of explaining everything. Myobject is merely to relate to you, in my own way, how the blind littlegod was deprived of his sight, and what consequences followed this evilwhich perchance was a blessing after all. On the latter point I willdecide nothing, but will leave it to lovers to judge upon.One day as Folly and Love were playing together, before the boy had losthis vision, a dispute arose. To settle this matter Love wished to layhis cause before a council of the gods; but Folly, losing her patience,dealt him a furious blow upon the brow. From that moment and for everthe light of heaven was gone from his eyes.Venus demanded redress and revenge, the mother and the wife in herasserting themselves in a way which I leave you to imagine. She deafenedthe gods with her cries, appealing to Jupiter, Nemesis, the judges fromHades, in fact all who would be importuned. She represented theseriousness of the case, pointing out that her son could now not make astep without a stick. No punishment, she urged, was heavy enough for sodire a crime, and she demanded that the damage should be repaired.When the gods had each well considered the public interest on the onehand and the complainant's demands upon the other, the supreme courtgave as its verdict that Folly was condemned for ever more to serve as aguide for the footsteps of Love.
