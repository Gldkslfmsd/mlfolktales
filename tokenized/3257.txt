hen —" you promise me shoes year after year , year after year , and yet i get no shoes !
" cock —" you shall have them , never fear !
henny penny !
" hen —" i lay egg after egg , egg after egg , and yet i go about barefoot !
" cock — well , take your eggs , and be off to the tryst , and buy yourself shoes , and don ’ t go any longer barefoot !"
