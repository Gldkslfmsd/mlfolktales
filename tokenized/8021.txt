this truth within the heart is graven :— all flattery is false ; and so , there ' s no excuse , if listeners succumb when flatterers seduce .
up on a little fir - tree lightly hopped a raven that wished to breakfast at her ease , and carried in her mouth a piece of fragrant cheese .
but while she pondered , then a morsel tasted , a fox adjudged the chance too perfect to be wasted .
was taken captive by the cheesy scent ; on looking up , no further on his journey went .
the rogue , on tip - toe , to the fir - tree slow approaches .
upon the bird ' s attention sly encroaches .
and gently says , in accents low and clear :— " oh , songster exquisite and dear .
your eyes are soft with love and pity , i humbly bow to one so pretty .
ne ' er have i seen such feathers , such a beak !
oh , queen of all the birds !
but let me hear you speak .
or rather , deign to sing !
enjoy a moment ' s leisure and charm the world with tones delightful beyond measure .
pour forth fine notes , my gracious treasure ! "
the raven held her breath , and nearly died from choking , and then , as if a wild ambition in her burned .
she opened wide her mouth for harsh discordant croaking .
and the fox gained the cheese his cunning skill had earned .
