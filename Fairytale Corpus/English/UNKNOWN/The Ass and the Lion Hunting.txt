A coward, full of pompous speech,The ignorant may overreach;But is the laughing-stock of thoseWho know how far his valor goes.Once on a time it came to pass,The Lion hunted with the Ass,Whom hiding in the thickest shadeHe there proposed should lend him aid,By trumpeting so strange a bray,That all the beasts he should dismay,And drive them o'er the desert heathInto the lurking Lion's teeth.Proud of the task, the long-ear'd loonStruck up such an outrageous tune,That 'twas a miracle to hear-The beasts forsake their haunts with fear,And in the Lion's fangs expired:Who, being now with slaughter tired,Call'd out the Ass, whose noise he stops.The Ass, parading from the copse,Cried out with most conceited scoff,"How did my music-piece go off?So well-were not thy courage known,Their terror had been all my own!"
