BY thirst incited; to the brookThe Wolf and Lamb themselves betook.The Wolf high up the current drank,The Lamb far lower down the bank.Then, bent his ravenous maw to cram,The Wolf took umbrage at the Lamb."How dare you trouble all the flood,And mingle my good drink with mud?""Sir," says the Lambkin, sore afraid,"How should I act, as you upbraid?The thing you mention cannot be,The stream descends from you to me."Abash'd by facts, says he, " I know'Tis now exact six months agoYou strove my honest fame to blot"-"Six months ago, sir, I was not.""Then 'twas th' old ram thy sire," he cried,And so he tore him, till he died.To those this fable I addressWho are determined to oppress,And trump up any false pretence,But they will injure innocence.
