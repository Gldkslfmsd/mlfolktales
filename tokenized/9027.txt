once upon a time there was a little mouse who , coming out of his hole , met an enormous lion . the lion wanted to eat him up .“ please , mr .
lion , don ’ t eat me .
one day you might need me .” the lion answered , “ why should i need someone as small as you ?” seeing how tiny the mouse was , the lion took pity on him and set him free . one day , the mouse heard an almight roar . it was the lion . when he got to the place , he found the lion trapped in a net .“ i ’ ll save you !” said the mouse .“ you ?” you are too small for such a hard task .” the mouse started to nibble at the rope of the net and the lion was saved . from that day on they were friends forever .
