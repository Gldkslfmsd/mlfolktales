once on a time the cock , the cuckoo , and the blackcock bought a cow between them .
but when they came to share it , and could not agree which should buy the others out , they settled that he who woke first in the morning should have the cow . so the cock woke first .
" now the cow ' s mine ! now the cow ' s mine ! hurrah !
hurrah !
" he crew , and as he crew , up awoke the cuckoo .
" half cow !
half cow !
" sang the cuckoo , and woke up the blackcock .
" a like share , a like share ; dear friends , that ' s only fair ! saw see !
see saw !
" that ' s what the blackcock said . and now , can you tell me which of them ought to have the cow ?
