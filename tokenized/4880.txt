the cat and fox , each like a little saint , on pious pilgrimage together went ; two real tartufes , two patelins , birds of prey , soft - footed rogues , who paid or cleared the way , picking the bones of poultry , stealing cheese , rivalling each other .
they the road to ease , for it was tedious and long , oft shortened by contentions sharp and strong . dispute ' s a very happy source ; without it restless souls would sleep of course . our pilgrims with it made each other hoarse , quarrelled their fill , then dirt on neighbours cast . reynard said to the cat at last : " pretender , are you bettor skilled than i , who could with tricks a hundred cats supply ?
"" no ," said the cat , " i only boast of one , but that ' s worth any thousand known .
" ready again their quarrel to begin , with " yes " and " no ," through thick and thin , the pack alarmed them , silencing their din .
" friend ," cried the cat , " now search your cunning brain , examine all your tricks , and search again for some sure plan -- mine ' s ready , do you see ?"
he said , and quick sprang up a lofty tree . sly reynard played a hundred pranks in vain , entered a hundred holes -- escaped assault , put finder and his brothers in default ; he sought asylum all around , but he nowhere asylum found . they watched the burrow where he hid so sly , and smoked him out -- two terriers were nigh , who worried him as he went bounding by . avoid too many schemes ; there ruin lies ; for while we choose , the happy moment flies . have but one plan , and let that plan be wise .
