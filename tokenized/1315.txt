between werrel and soist there lived a man whose name was knoist , and he had three sons .
one was blind , the other lame , and the third stark - naked .
once on a time they went into a field , and there they saw a hare .
the blind one shot it , the lame one caught it , the naked one put it in his pocket .
then they came to a mighty big lake , on which there were three boats , one sailed , one sank , the third had no bottom to it .
they all three got into the one with no bottom to it .
then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree ; in the tree was a mighty big chapel in the chapel was a sexton made of beech - wood and a box - wood parson , who dealt out holy - water with cudgels .
" how truly happy is that onewho can from holy water run !"
