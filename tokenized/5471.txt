the north wind and the sun disputed as to which was the most powerful , and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes .
the north wind first tried his power and blew with all his might , but the keener his blasts , the closer the traveler wrapped his cloak around him , until at last , resigning all hope of victory , the wind called upon the sun to see what he could do .
the sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth .
the traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another , and at last , fairly overcome with heat , undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path .
persuasion is better than force .
