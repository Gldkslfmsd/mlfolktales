a miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold , which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily .
one of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements .
he soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure , and digging down , came to the lump of gold , and stole it .
the miser , on his next visit , found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations .
a neighbor , seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause , said , " pray do not grieve so ; but go and take a stone , and place it in the hole , and fancy that the gold is still lying there .
it will do you quite the same service ; for when the gold was there , you had it not , as you did not make the slightest use of it ."
