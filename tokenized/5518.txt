a king , whose only son was fond of martial exercises , had a dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion .
afraid the dream should prove true , he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life - sized animals , among which was the picture of a lion .
when the young prince saw this , his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh , and , standing near the lion , he said : " o you most detestable of animals !
through a lying dream of my father ' s , which he saw in his sleep , i am shut up on your account in this palace as if i had been a girl : what shall i now do to you ?'
with these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn - tree , meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion .
but one of the tree ' s prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation , so that the young prince fell down in a fainting fit .
a violent fever suddenly set in , from which he died not many days later .
we had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them .
