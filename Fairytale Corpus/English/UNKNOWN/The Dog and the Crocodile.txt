Who give bad precepts to the wise,And cautious men with guile advise,Not only lose their toil and time,But slip into sarcastic rhyme.The dogs that are about the Nile,Through terror of the Crocodile,Are therefore said to drink and run.It happen'd on a day, that one,As scamp'ring by the river side,Was by the Crocodile espied:"Sir, at your leisure drink, nor fearThe least design or treach'ry here.""That," says the Dog, "ma'm, would I doWith all my heart, and thank you too,But as you can on dog's flesh dine,You shall not taste a bit of mine."
