There was a funeral. The dead body was progressing sadlytowards its last resting place; and following rather gladly, was thepriest who meant to bury it as soon as possible.The dead man, in a leaden coffin, was borne in a coach, and was properlyshrouded in that robe the dead always wear be it summer or winter. Asfor the priest, he sat near it, intoning as hard as he could all sortsof orisons, psalms, lessons, verses, and responses, in the hope that themore he gave the more would be paid for. "Leave it to me, Mr. Deadman,"his actions seemed to say. "I'll give you a nice selection; a little ofeverything. It's only a matter of fees, you know." And the Rev. JohnCrow kept his eye on his silent charge as if he expected some one wouldmake off with it. "Mr. Deadman," his looks proclaimed, "by you I shallreceive so and so much in money, so and so much in wax candles, and,possibly, a little more in incidental profits.On the strength of these calculations he promised himself a quarter-caskof the best wine the neighbourhood could offer. Beyond that he settledthat a certain very attractive niece of his, as well as his housekeeperPaquette, should both have new dresses.Whilst these pleasant and generous thoughts were running in his mindthere came a terrific shock. The car overturned. The Rev. John Crow'shead was broken by the coffin which fell upon him. Alas for the poorpriest! he went to heaven with the parishioner he thought only to bury.In reality, life over and over again is nothing but the fate of the Rev.John Crow who counted on his dead, and of Perrette who counted on herchickens.
