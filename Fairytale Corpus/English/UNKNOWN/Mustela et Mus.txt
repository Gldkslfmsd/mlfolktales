To you, who 've graver things bespoke,This seems no better than a joke,And light for mere amusement made;Yet still we drive the scribbling trade,And from the pen our pleasure find,When we've no greater things to mind.Yet if you look with care intense,These tales your toil shall recompense;Appearance is not always true,And thousands err by such a view.'Tis a choice spirit that has priedWhere clean contrivance chose to hide;That this is not at random said,I shall produce upon this headA fable of an arch device,About the Weasel and the Mice. A Weasel, worn with years, and lame,That could not overtake its game,Now with the nimble Mice to deal,Disguised herself with barley meal;Then negligent her limbs she spreadIn a sly nook, and lay for dead.A Mouse that thought she there might feed,Leapt up, and perish'd in the deed;A second in like manner died;A third, and sundry more beside:Then comes the brindled Mouse, a chapThat oft escaped both snare and trap,And seeing how the trick was played,Thus to his crafty foe he said:-"So may'st thou prosper day and night,As thou art not an errant bite."
