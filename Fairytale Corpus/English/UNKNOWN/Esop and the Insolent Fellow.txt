Fools from success perdition meet.An idle wretch about the streetAt Esop threw a stone in rage." So much the better," quoth the sage,And gives three farthings for the job;" I've no more money in my fob;But if you 'll follow my advice,More shall be levied in a trice."It happen'd that the selfsame hourCame by a man of wealth and pow'r." There, throw your pellet at my lord,And you shall have a sure reward!"The fellow did as he was told;But mark the downfall of the bold;His hopes are baulk'd, and, lo! he gainsA rope and gibbet for his pains.'
