how nice you seem to me ! really , if your voiceis like your plumage , you are the phoenix of all the inhabitants of these woods .
" at these words , the crow is overjoyed . and in order to show off his beautiful voice , he opens his beak wide , lets his prey fallthe fox grabs it , and says : " my good man , learn that every flattererlives at the expense of the one who listens to him . this lesson , without doubt , is well worth a cheese .
" the crow , ashamed and embarrassed , swore , but a little late , that he would not be taken again .
