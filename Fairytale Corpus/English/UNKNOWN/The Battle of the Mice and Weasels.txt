The routed Mice upon a dayFled from the Weasels in array;But in the hurry of the flight,What with their weakness and their frightEach scarce could get into his cave :Howe'er, at last their lives they save.But their commanders (who had tiedHorns to their heads in martial pride,Which as a signal they design'dFor non-commission'd mice to mind)Stick in the entrance as they go,And there are taken by the foe,Who, greedy of the victim, glutsWith mouse-flesh his ungodly guts.Each great and national distressMust chiefly mighty men oppress;While folks subordinate and poorAre by their littleness secure.
