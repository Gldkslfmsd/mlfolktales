once on a time there was a lad who was walking along a road cracking nuts , so he found one that was worm - eaten , and just at that very moment he met the deil .
" is it true , now ," said the lad , " what they say , that the deil can make himself as small as he chooses , and thrust himself in through a pinhole ?
"" yes , it is ," said the deil ." oh !
it is , is it ?
then let me see you do it , and just creep into this nut ," said the lad . so the deil did it . now , when he had crept well into it through the worm ' s hole , the lad stopped it up with a pin .
" now , i ' ve got you safe ," he said , and put the nut into his pocket . so when he had walked on a bit , he came to a smithy , and he turned in and asked the smith if he ' d be good enough to crack that nut for him .
" ay , that ' ll be an easy job ," said the smith , and took his smallest hammer , laid the nut on the anvil , and gave it a blow , but it wouldn ' t break . so he took another hammer a little bigger , but that wasn ' t heavy enough either . then he took one bigger still , but it was still the same story ; and so the smith got wroth , and grasped his great sledge - hammer .
" now , i ' ll crack you to bits ," he said , and let drive at the nut with all his might and main .
and so the nut flew to pieces with a bang that blew off half the roof of the smithy , and the whole house creaked and groaned as though it were ready to fall ." why !
if i don ' t think the deil must have been in that nut ," said the smith .
" so he was ; you ' re quite right ," said the lad , as he went away laughing .
